_This entry has been marinating for most of the year 2020. I should have published
this opinion way earlier maybe end of 2019, but it took me time to realise I should split
a bigger piece in smaller articles that hopefully made sense on their own._


== The stupid mistake

Like many I was happy to see the JDK landed support for containers in Java 9,
and that it was backported to Java 8 as well. Now the JDK 11 enables this
support by default. This change made the JVM able to read information from the
``cgroup``, and the `-XX:*RAMPercentage` flag family tells the JVM which _proportion_
of the available memory for this cgroup can be used.

In 2019, I had the chance the work on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) and putting
Java applications in docker containers. Then bad production experiences arose that
led me to think this flag may not be the right answer when applications are run in
containers.
_This opinion could be biased toward the application mileage and in the context they were run._

This flag did not work as I expected it to be, and I'm a bit the culprit on this one
as I failed to properly research. I didn't refresh this knowledge either at that time.
When this flag appeared –- as a fraction based flags first (`*RAMFraction`) -- mostly blogs
explored the new options (_like this https://merikan.com/2019/04/jvm-in-a-container/[one]_),
many thanks to authors of these blogs who did the research.

However, these blogs silently passed over the fact that `*RamPercentage` is
**about the Java heap** (the same way `MaxRAM` is about Java heap), I simply
overlooked that too.

If I turned on blogs first it's because the official documentation doesn't even mention
any `*RAMPercentage` flags:

I should have turned right away to this awesome contribution from https://twitter.com/chriswhocodes[Chris Newland],
he wrote a tool that indexes flag's documentations, defaults and other metadata in various OpenJDK codebase.

I knew this tool beforehand, yet I didn't use Chris's website first, I should have, and
you should too.

TIP: Naming things is hard and I think this flag family should have been called something
like `*HeapPercentageOfRAM` to prevent stupid errors.




== How the issue happened


.Context
****
In Kubernetes an application is deployed via a
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[deployment],
it allows to describe various aspects of the deployment like the container image,
how many https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/[replicas] are desired,
the roll-out strategy, environment variables, exposed ports,
the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[resources CPU or memory] it needs, etc.
//Also this deployment is using an https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[_horizontal pod auto-scaler_]
//whose role is to increase the number of instances based on some criteria, this application
//used the CPU usage as the deciding metric.

The application was running with `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=85` in a container constrained
to `3 GiB` of memory.

****


This should have led enough free space but instead the application
eventually hit the memory limit. Naturally the application got
killed by the OS. More dramatically *all* replicas eventually got quickly _oomkilled_ after
some time, which led Kubernetes to always deploy new pods.

This application worked very well on a different datacenter handling all the traffic with
a heap of `2 GiB`. The instances in Kubernetes could handle half of the traffic well but
not the entire traffic.

In short when the traffic on kubernetes instances got increased to 100%
the __pod__s started to get _oom-killed_.


image:/assets/maxrampercentage/app-jvm-memory-usage.png[JVM memory usage]

Caution, this graph has a slight issue as it displays data in _metric bytes_
while in reality this should be IEC bytes.

Above we can see the trend of the **R**esident **S**et **S**ize in green,
the Java heap limit (85% of `3 GiB`), and in yellow the current heap usage.


[NOTE]
====
Most of the time, figures will use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix[IEC binary notation] (`1 KiB = 1024 B`),
it matches the https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11u/blob/jdk-11.0.9%2B11/src/hotspot/share/utilities/globalDefinitions.hpp#L255[JVM],
our https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory[Kubernetes] usage,
and Linux's tools (`/proc/{pid}/stat` or `/proc/{pid}/maps` ; although I couldn't find a reference link stating this).

Some charts may however use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix[SI metric notation] (`1 KB = 1000 B`).

[quote, Java Performance: The Definitive Guide, Getting the Most Out of Your Code (1st Edition)]
Actually, 227,893 KB is only 222 MB. For ease of discussion, I'll truncate the KBs part by 1,000
in this chapter; pretend I'm a disk manufacturer.

== With `*RAMPercentage` should I just raise available memory ?

This application don't have memory leaks. So we have two parameters on why
it's possible to adjust memory :

. The cgroup available memory (set via Kubernetes deployment object key `.resources.limits.memory`).
. The Java Heap parameters.

Yet the premise is to use `MaxRAMPercentage` which defines a percentage of
the former option (cgroup's available memory), that would suggests that we only have
to raise the available memory.

.memory limits in the deployment object of the app
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: "java-app"
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: "java-app"
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "8"
            memory: "5Gi" # <1>
          requests:
            cpu: "3"
            memory: "3Gi"
----
<1> Increasing the working memory limit.


[TIP]
=======
The resources tree is equivalent to this docker params

[source]
----
docker run \
  --cpu-shares=3 \ # <1>
  --cpu-quota=8 \ # <2>
  --memory=5g \ # <3>
  ...
----
<1> cpu request, this is the relative weight of that container for CPU time
<2> cpu limit, this limits the CPU time of container’s processes, that means throttling
<3> memory limit, tells the OS to kill (`oomkill`) the container's processes if they hit this limit

The memory request is only used for scheduling the pod on a node.
=======


That would be really convenient!

In practice, I found this approach lacking, and inefficient for various reasons :

. It's just easy to raise the memory limit, but this may have a
hidden cost, as this percentage is not adjusted. If the deployment
requires a limit of 6 GiB, to work while the application is only using
3 GiB (if the application don't need OS cache), then it has two consequences
.. larger application will impact negatively Kubernetes scheduling (which selects
where to run the container), either on this very application or on sibling containers.
.. this cluster cost more than what is consume.

. This immediately leads to this point: the percentage used in `MaxRAMPercentage`
can't stay a fixed value, it needs adjustment like we used to for `Xmx` style flags,
and for the same reasons:
.. the traffic load may change
.. the number of instances or replicas may change
.. application code may change the mileage

. Adjusting the memory of either the Java Heap or the limit
of the container is annoying because `MaxRAMPercentage` requires to
perform a rule of three. This may seem petty but it's just easier to
work with actual values, here percentage have no real benefits.

. GC parameters also use percentages, which forces sometime to calculate
percentage of percentage.

. Using percentage for Java heap makes us dismiss an entire facet of the memory,
native memory. This memory in particular does grow too, but with in
the same way than heap.


== Final words

Concretely I find no compelling argument in favor of `*RAMPercentage` flags,
I don't know if I'm old school, or mathematics-averse but I find `Xms` / `Xmx`
easier to work with even in the context of containers.

Using values with a unit encourage one to understand how an application is
working, what constitutes the RSS for a Java process (which I'll explore in
an article maturing a bit longer).
