== Integrate Asciidoctor as everyone should expect

While Hugo comes with Asciidoctor support, they are in reality several issues
to account for at this time:

While basic rendering of asciidoc files works, we soon encounter problems ;
the very first 

* [x] Source listings are not _syntax-highlighted_.
* [x] Include directives don't work
* [x] There's no icons with admonition blocks
* [x] Source listing callouts are way off

So reading a few blogs posts to tackle these issues, and learn :

* https://jshingler.github.io/blog/2019/12/07/creating-this-site/
* https://rgielen.net/posts/2019/creating-a-blog-with-hugo-and-asciidoctor/

=== The first useful hack


TIP: First we need to be able to override how `hugo` invoke `asciidoctor`.
Hugo expects an executable name `asciidoctor`, we can trick it to run a
shell script instead, by creating in the repository a file named
`./bin/asciidoctor`. Then run hugo with the following environment :
`env PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH hugo serve`.

Hugo uses : `--no-header-footer --safe --trace -` args, as seen in
https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/4205844bcecdc9e1e9456e088a49f38b354ed5a6/markup/asciidoc/convert.go#L72[`getAsciidocContent`].

.from the https://asciidoctor.org/man/asciidoctor/[man page]
|===
| `--safe`
| Set safe mode level to safe. Enables include directives, but prevents access to ancestor paths of source file. Provided for compatibility with the asciidoc command. If not set, the safe mode level defaults to unsafe when Asciidoctor is invoked using this script.

| `-s`, `--no-header-footer`
| Output an embeddable document, which excludes the header, the footer, and everything outside the body of the document. This option is useful for producing documents that can be inserted into an external template.

| `-`
| If FILE is - then the AsciiDoc source is read from standard input.
|===

So using the trick learned in the above blog posts, and with quite a bit of
trial and error I got up the following script:

../bin/asciidoctor
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh

ad="/usr/local/bin/asciidoctor"

$ad --trace --verbose \
  --base-dir ./content \                        #  <1>
  --no-header-footer \                          #  <2>
  --attribute nofooter \
  --attribute docinfo=shared \
  --attribute icons=font \                      #  <3>
  --attribute source-highlighter=highlightjs \  #  <4>
  --attribute sectlinks \                       #  <5>
  --attribute sectanchors \
  --attribute figure-caption! \
  --attribute toc-title! \
  -                                             #  <6>

----
<1> The dot `.` is where hugo has been started, usually it's the Hugo
site root, and `content` is where website content is located by default,
so the content folder is the base directory of asciidoc, this is important
for `include:` directives where the path will be relative to the `./content`
folder. This option is useful because asciidoctor is invoked to use
stdin/stdout via `-`
<2> The *most important settings*, tell asciidoctor to not
generate the header and footer as those are part of the Hugo theme,
in addition, this command also tells to not generate content footer
and trick asciidoctor to believe header and footer are part of
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.org/blob/master/docs/_includes/docinfo.adoc#naming-docinfo-files[docinfo]
by using the value `shared`. This helps in case of some external
script that are being injected like FontAwesome, Highlight.JS,
or MathJax for example.
<3> Use Font Awesome, however Asciidoctor uses Font Awesome 4 which can be
tricky to integrate in a theme that rely on Font Awesome 5.
<4> This tells Asciidoctor to render `pre code` elements with
highlight.js information for them. This require that the theme correctly
set-up Highlight.JS.
<5> `sectlinks`, `sectanchors`, `figure-caption`, or `toc-title` are attributes
to tweak the rendering, usually they are part of the document, but since I prefer to
have this setting global they are here in the command line.
<6> Read the source from stdin

Then run `hugo` by overriding the `PATH` environment variable.

.locally with `./bin/asciidoctor` script
[source,bash]
----
exec env PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH hugo # the hugo options
----


By the way if you forgot the `--no-header-footer` option the whole HTML document
produced by asciidoctor is inserted by Hugo (as expected in fact) in the generated page.
Inline CSS and scripts import emitted by Asciidoctor are then competing with
the one of the Hugo theme.

=== Porting the asciidoctor CSS

So now that we have the content HTML structure, the rendering of the article
is still way off.

* [x] source listings are not _syntax-highlighted_.
* [x] Font Awesome icons are missing, incompatibility between FA4 and FA5
* [x] CSS is off or way off for almost all elements of Asciidoctor's particular features,


The process was tedious, just copying the default asciidoctor css isn't
quite the right thing as stylesheet from the theme and the stylesheet from asciidoctor
interfere, (_corrupting_ other elements of the theme like the sidebar).

For example the theme alternate the background color table's rows, and asciidoctor
rely on lot on tables to layout some features, be it callout, admonition blocks,
some lists, etc. in order to fix that the CSS has t be patched with rules like these:

[source,css]
----
tbody tr:nth-child(2n+1) td, tbody tr:nth-child(2n+1) th {
  background-color: inherit;
}
----

.Using the web tools inspector to debug CSS issues
image:{image-assets}/tackling-hugo-asciidoctor/asciidoctor-css-debug.png[width="50%"]

Actually this work took significantly more time that I was prepared for,
fortunately the Asciidoctor default CSS helped, and the way the theme of my
choosing was using _Sass_ (many other thems use it as it's part of Hugo).

I ported and tweaked necessary Asciidoctor CSS rules to my `scss` files using
an online https://css2sass.herokuapp.com/[CSS to SASS/SCSS converter]. I'm
not a web developer so the result is probably incorrect, inefficient in some part
but it works for the feature I'm using.

Like thme layout overrides, hugo let's you override scss files in the respective
directories like `./assets/scss`.

../assets/scss/hyde-hyde.scss
[source,scss]
----
@import "hyde-hyde/variables";
// poole
@import "poole/base";
@import "poole/layout";
@import "poole/posts";
// hyde-hyde
@import 'hyde-hyde/mixins';
@import 'hyde-hyde/base';
@import 'hyde-hyde/sidebar';
@import 'hyde-hyde/list';
@import 'hyde-hyde/post';
@import 'hyde-hyde/code';
@import 'hyde-hyde/gist';
@import 'hyde-hyde/navigation';
@import 'hyde-hyde/taxonomies';
@import 'hyde-hyde/project';
@import 'hyde-hyde/responsive';
@import 'hyde-hyde/misc';
@import 'hyde-hyde/theme';
@import 'hyde-hyde/asciidoctor';  // <1>
----
<1> Imports asciidoctor last.


../assets/scss/hyde-hyde/asciidoctor.scss
[source,scss]
----
.post { // <1>
  // asciidoctor style
}
----
<1> Make asciidoctor rule applied within the first `.post` class
this is necessary otherwise asciidoctor rules may interfere with
theme elements that are name the same, such as `.sidebar`, or `.title`

The current https://github.com/bric3/bric3.github.io/blob/48a572d2c7778219984e2678664cb435788a2915/assets/scss/hyde-hyde/_asciidoctor.scss[state of this file]
covers most features of Asciidoctor but a few leftover like colors.


=== Resolving Font Awesome 4/5 issues

One of the neat thing about Asciidoctor is their use of Font Awesome is
various parts like admonition icons. This is activated whith this attribute
definition `:fonts: icons`.

But, Asciidoctor 2.0.10 uses Font Awesome 4.7, which is incompatible
with my theme as it is using FOnt Awesome 5. This took me quite a while
to figure out a solution, and _it's not perfect either_.

To be more specific let's dive into the admonition block `TIP:`, Asciidoctor
will generate HTML with the `icon-tip` class.

[source,html]
----
<td class="icon">
    <i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
----

Asciidoctor uses the _pseudo-element_ `::before` in order to display
the right icon. So only using unicode character code, and the right font family
should do it.

[source,scss]
----
td.icon {
  [class^="fa icon-"] {
    font-size: 2rem;
    font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free'; // <1>
    cursor: default;
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    text-rendering: auto;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  }
  .icon-tip::before {
    content: "\f0eb"; // <2>
    font-weight: 400; // <3>
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(155, 155, 0, 0.8);
  }
}
----
<1> Use the FA5 font family that has the icons
<2> Equivalent to `<i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i>`, but use the right
`font-weight` to access the free icons in the _Regular_ set
<3> `400` allows access to the Regular set, however only icons present in
the font family are present, in the Free family only a few Regular icons are
available.

.The fail
However, this didn't work quite well. As I dicovered that the SVG framework
that is used when the JS scripts are loaded at the end of the page don't quite
like the `fa icon-tip` class. The script always replace this element
by the missing icon (a dotted circle with an exclamation mark alterning with a
question mark). I tried may variations, adding script in the `head`, at the end,
playing with `defer`, etc.

.does not work

----

It took me a while but I ultimately decided to remove the usage of the SVG framework
and as such loading these scripts as I never got them to work.
Leaving only the FA5 CSS imports.

And now tada, even with the asciidoctor macro `icon:<fa4 icon name>[]` :

====
icon:tags[] icon:pepper-hot[] icon:fort-awesome[] icon:git[]
====

But be sure to use https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/[FA4 icons], otherwise
the icon won't be found :

====
icon:java[]
====

Yet it is still possible to use asciidoctor's
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#pass-macros[passthrough macro] with the HTML
right class from FA5 `<i class="fab fa-java fa-3x"></i>`

====
+++ <i class="fab fa-java fa-3x"></i> +++
====

or the `\pass:[<i class="fab fa-java fa-2x"></i>]` inline macro

====
pass:[<i class="fab fa-java fa-2x"></i>]

=== Trying the semantic HTML5 backend

Also, one of the blog post is suggesting to switch to semantic HTML5, because the
structure of the HTML5 asciidoctor's backend is not modern enough, e.g.

[source,html]
----
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve crafted my own simple shortcode for Amazon <code>{{&lt; amzn "B07XW76VHZ" &gt;}}</code> :</p>
</div>
----

Using the *semantic* HTML5 backend as suggested in this https://ratfactor.com/hugo-adoc-html5s/[blog post]
require to `gem install asciidoctor-html5s`. And pass this option in the
script `--backend html5s`.

In practice the Semantic HTML5 converter from https://github.com/jirutka/asciidoctor-html5s
outputs semantic HTML, but doesn't support all features of asciidoctor like
icons for admonition blocks, also it uses the asciidoctor default CSS which
is not suited for this semantic HTML5 tree: elements differ, CSS class names differ as well.

So while this slightly improves the HTML structure, this made CSS port too challenging
for me, broken syntax highlighting, titles are not styled as expected, etc., so I didn't
use it in the end. At least this decision didn't increase the complexity of the setup.


=== Using diagrams

NOTE: 2020-09-20: Hugo 0.74.0 and asciidoctor-diagram 2.0.3 finally allowed me to get rid of the setup
below, which is nice in particular for diagrams. I'll blog about the change at some point.

Asciidoctor has a useful extension `asciidoctor-diagram` that allows the generation of
diagrams from simple text listing, this may not be necessary for everyone, but it was
a mandatory thing for me.

It's necessary to install the extension `gem install asciidoctor-diagram`
and to adapt the `./bin/asciidoctor` script to

../bin/asciidoctor
[source,diff]
----
  $ad --trace --verbose \
    --base-dir ./content \
+   --require asciidoctor-diagram \
    --no-header-footer \
    --attribute nofooter \
    --attribute docinfo=shared \
----

This wasn't enough as `asciidoctor-diagram` outputs the generated SVG
in the wrong directory to be served by Hugo. I got a tip by reading this
https://www.zipproth.com/cheat-sheets/hugo-asciidoctor/[blog entry], which
consists in modifying the URI of the diagrams in the rendered HTML, and moving
the generated files.


../bin/asciidoctor
[source,diff]
----
    --attribute sectanchors \
    --attribute figure-caption! \
    --attribute toc-title! \
-   -
+   - | sed -E -e "s/img src=\"([^/]+)\"/img src=\"\/diagram\/\1\"/"
+
+ mkdir -p static/diagram
+
+ if ls *.svg >/dev/null 2>&1; then
+ mv -f *.svg static/diagram
+ fi
+
+ if ls *.png >/dev/null 2>&1; then
+ mv -f *.png static/diagram
+ fi
----

In practice, I wasn't satisfied by this setup for several reasons:

. The `sed` targets all `img` elements.
. The files are moved in `static/diagram`, this is the most annoying point,
because
.. This move operation is not performed atomically with the content rendering, thus
when served locally it triggers another refresh, which also triggers the rendering of
the original document and then regenerate the diagram images which are again moved
to `static/diagram`, triggering another refresh cycle.
.. The generated files are moved in the `static` folder but are not supposed to be
put in _git_, this can create unnecessary noise.

To be faire the orignal blog post runs `hugo serve` with these options
`--disableFastRender --disableLiveReload --renderToDisk`.

I couldn't get a satisfying solution, so I decided to inline the generated SVG,
by declaring the `opts="inline"` in the descriptor.

[source, asciidoc]
------
[plantuml,"sequence-diagram-example",format="svg",opts="inline"]
.Sequence diagram
----
// plantuml
----
------

This doesn't require to pipe the output to `sed` and `mv` SVGs afterwards,
but the `asciidoctor-diagram` outputs the images in the basedir.

While I've tried to set `imagesoutdir` or `out_dir` attributes in `./bin/asciidoctor`
as documented (https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/#image-output-location[her]):
Diagrams will be put in the mentioned folder like `resources/_gen` yet somehow there still
stored on `basedir` as well.

Also, I have tried to make SVG inlining as default for diagrams using this
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram/commit/2bf075fe07dde384326e47282970832b6f7aeb1d[change]
that appeared in Asciidoctor 2, but it didn't quite work as expected, as explained in
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram/issues/247#issuecomment-617469310[asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram#247 comment].

Also, in the future it may be interesting to look at using
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/tree/master/lib/chart-block-macro[charts macro],
like suggested by https://dburet.gitlab.io/blog/2020-01-22-adoc-chart/[this blog post].


=== Tweaking `.gitignore`

For me this ws due to `asciidoctor-diagram` that generates files
here in a `.asciidoctor` directory which is located in the configured base directory.
Let's ignore it.

..gitignore

== Adapting Github Actions

As seen in the previous entry, the site is rendered by a Github Action job,
this job needs to be updated to run asciidoctor the way I want it.
Fortunately I read few
https://www.morling.dev/blog/automatically-deploying-hugo-website-via-github-actions/[blog]
https://rgielen.net/posts/2019/creating-a-dockerized-hugo-asciidoctor-toolchain/[entries]
on the topic.

I mostly got inspired by https://github.com/gunnarmorling[Gunnar Morling] in this matter,
and looked on his https://github.com/gunnarmorling/morling.dev[github repository] to see
on it was done. And went the same way.


=== Make a docker image with `hugo` and `asciidoctor`

His workflow is now based on running a docker image that has
asciidoctor and hugo.

Since I wanted a full featured asciidoctor experience I needed something more
that was in his https://github.com/gunnarmorling/hugo-builder[image].

==== Trying to use docker-asciidoctor

I tried to use https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor[asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor]
as a base image since it offers the whole https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor/blob/master/Dockerfile[experience].
And it easy to just download and install a single executable.

However, I experienced issues to execute `hugo`, I suspect this is due to `alpine` base
but I wasn't able to pin point the issue:

[source]

==== Create my own image

I ended up forking https://github.com/gunnarmorling/hugo-builder[gunnarmorling/hugo-builder]
to adapt it to my needs, installing a more recent version of hugo, asciidoctor-diagrams,
make hugo use of the `asciidoctor` script hack.

TIP: I found this https://medium.com/better-programming/build-your-docker-images-automatically-when-you-push-on-github-18e80ece76af[blog]
instructions easy to follow in order to publish my own image on docker hub.

THe only issue I've encountered is that I forgot that a JDK is necessary to run
`asciidoctor-diagram`.

=== Modifying the GA workflow

Then using this docker image I change the Github Action workflow to this.

=== A note about speed

Using asciidoctor the rendering speed certainly took a hit, let's compare some numbers.
(*It's not reasonable benchmark though*, but the magnitude of the hit certainly gives an indication).

<1> ~28s to build the whole website in Docker with two asciidoctor
articles and around ten diagrams.
<2> ~4.8s seconds to build the whole website with two asciidoctor
articles and around ten diagrams.
<3> 145ms to build the whole website, but the two asciidoctor articles (those were drafts)

The docker `hugo serve` takes quite a long time, even when the site is rebuilt watching
the changes, so docker based may have to be used with care. Fortunately the local `hugo serve`
is much more fast to respond to change.

==== Trying with Asciidoctorj

In order to see if speed improved, I tried to use `asciidoctorj` instead,
it comes packed with asciidoctor-diagram by default, that's useful.

<1> Use `asciidoctorj`, that bath is usually the one from Homebrew,
maybe Linuxbrew and others
<2> Asciidoctorj 2.x is packed with `asciidoctorj-diagram`, and it's not necessary
to install the gem, but it's necessary to add the `--require` option.
<3> I'm not yet sure why but any message appearing there are treated as errors
by Hugo, which terminates the process, so this simply tell to ignore them.

But in the end the speed is not quite that either, but this may be because
I only have two Asciidoc articles at this time, so the JVM bootstrap doesn't
quite worth it. I'll revisit this later if needed. Especially for the diagram part.


== Wrap up

I went to Hugo because it supports Asciidoctor, however I didn't expect so much work
to benefit from a near complete Asciidoctor experience. And the current work
isn't even over.

I wasn't looking for such _asciidoctor_ or _asciidoc_ tag when bootstrapping the site,
but looking now I wish there was theme with asciidoctor support right out of the box,
yet no theme have the https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/asciidoctor/[asciidoctor tag] at this time.

I really must thank all the people that blogged about this before, they really helped
to make this happen.


Over the time I need to tackle some remaining topic

. [ ] Some color codes are missing, see #_text[this section] of the smoke test
. [ ] Table of content
. [ ] Extract colors in Sass variables
. [ ] Investigate custom macros, also see the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab[extension lab]
. [ ] Investigate `-a data-uri` or `-a diagram-svg-type=inline`
. [ ] Charts macro
. [ ] MathJax (stem)

_The last two point could certainly be made optional by adding a toggle in the front matter that can activate something in the theme._

What really helped me was the help of a _smoke test_ content to check what feature works or not,
I adapted this https://gist.github.com/mojavelinux/4402636[gist] from
https://gist.github.com/mojavelinux[Dan Allen] who is the project lead of
https://github.com/asciidoctor[asciidoctor]:
