IMPORTANT: https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/[JDK-17] will be released on
the September 14th 2021, it will come with another incubator
https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/412[JEP-412] for foreign function and foreign
memory, go to the
https://blog.arkey.fr/2021/09/04/a-practical-look-at-jep-412-in-jdk17-with-libsodium/[updated article for JDK-17].


JDK 16 is coming and with the *incubating* https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/389[JEP-389]
(Foreign Linker API).


The Foreign Linker API is a very convenient and attractive way to connect to
the native world. Let's have a practical look at this API that should supersede JNI.
In order to do so I wanted Java code to interact with the infamous
https://doc.libsodium.org/[*libsodium*].

First I will focus on using the foreign linker API, then I will show how to use
`jextract` in its current state (it is still being actively developed).


CAUTION: Note that JEP-389 is still incubating, therefore examples below are to be
obsolete for the next JDK as API and behavior are further refined.

TIP: The following examples were based on *JDK 16 release candidate build 36 (2021/2/8)*.

_Thanks to https://twitter.com/jpbempel[Jean-Phillipe Bempel] for the review and
in particular spotting errors_.

== The crypto sealed box example

Let's try to reproduce the following example from the
https://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes[libsodium sealbox documentation],
on this page there is a simple code snippet, that could be interesting to reproduce in Java.

.Crypto sealed box example
[source, c]
----
#define MESSAGE (const unsigned char *) "Message"
#define MESSAGE_LEN 7
#define CIPHERTEXT_LEN (crypto_box_SEALBYTES + MESSAGE_LEN)

/* Recipient creates a long-term key pair */
unsigned char recipient_pk[crypto_box_PUBLICKEYBYTES];
unsigned char recipient_sk[crypto_box_SECRETKEYBYTES];
crypto_box_keypair(recipient_pk, recipient_sk);

/* Anonymous sender encrypts a message using an ephemeral key pair
 * and the recipient's public key */
unsigned char ciphertext[CIPHERTEXT_LEN];
crypto_box_seal(ciphertext, MESSAGE, MESSAGE_LEN, recipient_pk);

/* Recipient decrypts the ciphertext */
unsigned char decrypted[MESSAGE_LEN];
if (crypto_box_seal_open(decrypted, ciphertext, CIPHERTEXT_LEN,
                         recipient_pk, recipient_sk) != 0) {
    /* message corrupted or not intended for this recipient */
}
----

=== Testing the idea in `jshell`

One of the cool thing with `jshell` is that you can try small ideas with a rapid
feedback loop. With the right configuration, it is also possible to play the
foreign linker.

.Allow jshell to use the foreign module
[source, shell]
----
$ jshell --add-modules jdk.incubator.foreign -R-Dforeign.restricted=permit
----

Then within jshell, let's try out a simple smoke test.

.Smoke testing the foreign module
[source]
----
jshell> import java.lang.invoke.*;
jshell> import jdk.incubator.foreign.*;
jshell> var getpid = CLinker.getInstance()
   ...>                     .downcallHandle(
   ...>                             LibraryLookup.ofDefault().lookup("getpid").get(),
   ...>                             MethodType.methodType(long.class),
   ...>                             FunctionDescriptor.of(CLinker.C_LONG)
   ...>                     );
getpid ==> MethodHandle()long

jshell> (long) getpid.invokeExact();
$4 ==> 53699

jshell> ProcessHandle.current().pid()
$5 ==> 53699
----

Yes it works ! It really is easy to try a things for almost free, without
leaving Java this is really neat. Now I would like to focus on the small example
with libsodium within a project. I'll explain how to use the API along the way.


=== Configuring Gradle

The incubating modules are not on the default module path. Hence, it is required
to add the `jdk.incubator.foreign` module when invoking the compilation command.

[source, shell]
----
$ javac --add-modules jdk.incubator.foreign ...
----

This module also needs to be declared when running this code, as well as
another property `foreign.restricted` to be able to invoke native code.

[source, shell]
----
$ java -Dforeign.restricted=permit --add-modules jdk.incubator.foreign ...
----

If you like to play with `jshell`, it will be necessary to use these two as well

[source, shell]
----
$ jshell -R-Dforeign.restricted=permit --add-modules jdk.incubator.foreign ...
----

Then comes the question to configure the build tool. I am using Gradle, the
configuration is likely similar for other build tool.

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
// ...

java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion.set(JavaLanguageVersion.of(16))
    }
}

tasks {
    withType<JavaCompile>().configureEach {
        options.forkOptions.jvmArgs = listOf(
                "--add-opens", "jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.code=ALL-UNNAMED" // <1>
        )

        options.compilerArgs = listOf(
                "--add-modules", "jdk.incubator.foreign" // <2>
        )
        options.release.set(16)
    }

    withType<JavaExec>().configureEach {
        jvmArgs("-Dforeign.restricted=permit", // <3>
                "--add-modules", "jdk.incubator.foreign")
    }

    withType<Test>().configureEach {
        useJUnitPlatform()
        jvmArgs("-Dforeign.restricted=permit", // <4>
                "--add-modules", "jdk.incubator.foreign")
    }
}
----
<1> Gradle itself can run on a different JDK, but the code needs to be compiled
with JDK16, at this time Gradle 6.8.2 does not support the new module restriction
introduced with JDK16 by default, hence it is necessary to explicitly open modules.
See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/15538#issuecomment-744299876[gradle/gradle#15538].
<2> Let the compiler knows about the `jdk.incubator.foreign` module
<3> Configure the tasks that executes a main class, while this is not immediately useful
IntelliJ IDEA will pick up this configuration, when you click running a `main` method.
<4> Configure test tasks to be able to run `jdk.incubator.foreign` tests.

=== The first and minimal call `crypto_box_sealbytes`

The first lines makes use of a few macros (the lines starting with `#define`),
we can assume that `MESSAGE` will be a method parameter, `MESSAGE_LEN`
will be derived from the message parameter, and `CIPHERTEXT_LEN` is also derived
from the message but needs another constant `crypto_box_SEALBYTES`.

The first thing needed is to acquire the `crypto_box_SEALBYTES` constant, looking at
https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/ae4add868124a32d4e54da10f9cd99240aecc0aa/src/libsodium/include/sodium/crypto_box.h#L125-L127[`crypto_box.h`]
there's a method `size_t crypto_box_sealbytes(void);` that returns this constant.

It's simple, and it will be the first method I will present here.

The first challenge is to map the return type `size_t`, _unsigned integer type_,
since the constant
https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/ae4add868124a32d4e54da10f9cd99240aecc0aa/src/libsodium/include/sodium/crypto_box.h#L125-L127[^1^]
https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/ae4add868124a32d4e54da10f9cd99240aecc0aa/src/libsodium/include/sodium/crypto_box_curve25519xsalsa20poly1305.h#L19[^2^]
https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/ae4add868124a32d4e54da10f9cd99240aecc0aa/src/libsodium/include/sodium/crypto_box_curve25519xsalsa20poly1305.h#L35[^3^]
is inferior to the integer max value and that I'd like to use
this as an array size, I will map it to an `int`.

.crypto_box_sealbytes (.java)
[source, java]
----
MethodHandle crypto_box_sealbytes =
        CLinker.getInstance()
               .downcallHandle(
                       libsodiumLookup.lookup("crypto_box_sealbytes").get(),
                       MethodType.methodType(int.class),
                       FunctionDescriptor.of(CLinker.C_INT)
               );

var crypto_box_SEALBYTES = (int) crypto_box_sealbytes.invokeExact();
----

The java type and the C descriptor must match, otherwise the call will fail at
runtime with a `IllegalArgumentException`.

.Carrier mismatch long != b32
[role="primary"]
====
If the java method type used `long.class`, and the C descriptor was `C_INT`,
the code would have failed with a carrier mismatch.

[source]
----
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Carrier size mismatch: long != b32[abi/kind=INT]
----
====

.Carrier mismatch int != b64
[role="secondary"]
====
If the java method type used `int.class`, and the C descriptor was `C_LONG`,
the code would have failed with a carrier mismatch.

[source]
----
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Carrier size mismatch: int != b64[abi/kind=LONG]
----
====

For reference, `CLinker.C_INT` is actually a `MemoryLayout`, a _layout_ is used
to model native memory.


=== Then a more interesting case, passing argument pointers

The next part of the example is a little more involved code, the
`crypto_box_keypair` method takes two array pointers `recipient_pk` and
`recipient_sk`, the generated keypair will be written to the given byte array.

.crypto_box_keypair (.c)
[source, c]
----
unsigned char recipient_pk[crypto_box_PUBLICKEYBYTES];
unsigned char recipient_sk[crypto_box_SECRETKEYBYTES];
crypto_box_keypair(recipient_pk, recipient_sk);
----

In order to initialize the size of these arrays, the codes needs
two constants `crypto_box_PUBLICKEYBYTES` and
`crypto_box_SECRETKEYBYTES`. To access these two it'll be the same
as `crypto_box_SEALBYTES`.

The C mapping is easy to get : a void method that takes 2 pointers 
`FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid(C_POINTER, C_POINTER)`. In Java the method type
require a type called `MemoryAddress` which represents the pointer address.

The pointers need to point to some memory. That's what the `MemorySegment` type
is for. Before invoking the method the necessary memory will be allocated
via `MemorySegment::allocateNative`, and the respective memory segment address
will be passed.

.crypto_box_keypair (.java)
[source, java]
----
MethodHandle crypto_box_keypair =
        CLinker.getInstance().downcallHandle(
                libsodiumLookup.lookup("crypto_box_keypair").get(),
                MethodType.methodType(
                        void.class,
                        MemoryAddress.class, // pk
                        MemoryAddress.class  // sk
                ),
                FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid(C_POINTER, C_POINTER)
        );

var recipientPublicKey = MemorySegment.allocateNative(crypto_box_publickeybytes());
var recipientSecretKey = MemorySegment.allocateNative(crypto_box_secretkeybytes());
crypto_box_keypair.invokeExact(recipientPublicKey.address(),
                               recipientSecretKey.address());

var kp = new CryptoBoxKeyPair(
        recipientPublicKey.toByteArray(),
        recipientSecretKey.toByteArray()
);
----

IMPORTANT: This code works, but there is something that must be taken care of,
*the native segment lifecycle*.

The above code snippet *never* deallocate native memory. Fortunately
in JDK 16 the `MemorySegment` class implements `AutoCloseable`, declaring it
in a _try-with_resources_ block will solve the issue.

.`MemorySegment` lifecycle
[sorce, java]
----
try (var recipientPublicKey = MemorySegment.allocateNative(crypto_box_publickeybytes());
     var recipientSecretKey = MemorySegment.allocateNative(crypto_box_secretkeybytes())) {
    crypto_box_keypair.invokeExact(recipientPublicKey.address(),
                                   recipientSecretKey.address());

    return new CryptoBoxKeyPair(
            recipientPublicKey.toByteArray(),
            recipientSecretKey.toByteArray()
    );
}
----

However, JEP-389 comes with the concept of scopes, which allows to express
temporal bounds of these segments, in JDK16 look for the `NativeScope` class,
it allows registering segments in a _code section_ and allocating segments
anywhere in this section.

.crypto_box_keypair with `NativeScope` (.java)
[source, java]
----
try (var scope = NativeScope.unboundedScope()) {
    var recipientPublicKey = scope.allocate(crypto_box_publickeybytes());
    var recipientSecretKey = scope.allocate(crypto_box_secretkeybytes());

    crypto_box_keypair.invokeExact(recipientPublicKey.address(),
                                   recipientSecretKey.address());

    return new CryptoBoxKeyPair(
            recipientPublicKey.toByteArray(),
            recipientSecretKey.toByteArray()
    );
}
----

In order to get back the off-heap content into Java types, the code can call
any of the `to{The Java Type}` methods on the `MemorySegment` instance, they
will take care of the conversion.

=== Next invoking the sealing method

The next method to call is `crypto_box_seal`, which also takes
pointers and a message length.

.crypto_box_seal (.c)
[source, c]
----
unsigned char ciphertext[CIPHERTEXT_LEN];
crypto_box_seal(ciphertext, MESSAGE, MESSAGE_LEN, recipient_pk);
----

When looking at the
https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/ae4add868124a32d4e54da10f9cd99240aecc0aa/src/libsodium/include/sodium/crypto_box.h#L129-L132[C signature]
however we notice something _unusual_ for Java developers: the message length
argument is of type `long long`!

In C or C++, this declaration means the type is at least 8 bytes (64 bits),
this means a Java `long` type is what is needed.

In particular here's a breakdown of the signed integers. It is incomplete
as they can be declared differently (eg. `long` is the same as `long int`,
or `long long` is the same as `long long int`), this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types[wikipedia page] has a more complete overview of
C data types.

{{< wrapTable >}}

.Signed integers
[cols="2m,8a"]
|===

| int | A signed integer type with "the natural size suggested by the
architecture of the execution environment", +
with a minimum of 2 byte (16 bits, asciimath:[[-32767; +32767\]]).

On a 64bits CPU, `int` is 4bytes and the range becomes asciimath:[[-2147483647; +2147483647\]];
| long | A signed integer type that is at least so 4 bytes (asciimath:[[-2147483647; +2147483647\]]).

On a 64bits CPU, `long` is 8bytes and the range becomes asciimath:[[−9223372036854775807; +9223372036854775807\]];

| long long | A signed integer type that is at least so 8 bytes (asciimath:[[−9223372036854775807; +9223372036854775807\]]).

On a 64bits CPU, `long long` is still 8 bytes long.

|===

{{< /wrapTable >}}

[CAUTION]
====
When you start to study these C data types a bit more, you'll notice
two things that just don't match with Java types:

* `unsigned` integers, while they do have the same width as their signed
counterpart, their math is different as their range is different:
** ``unsigned long``'s range is stem:[[0; +4294967295\]] (on a 64 bit CPU)
** ``unsigned long long``'s range is stem:[[0; +18446744073709551615\]] (on a 64 bit CPU)
* ``long double``s are larger than 64 bytes, I never had to use those, but it
seems they can be as big as 128 bits (16 bytes).

As a reminder `size_t` is unsigned.

Also, for this post, and I intend to pass a short `String` message,
which is baked by a `char` array whose length can only be an `int`.

    var ret = (int) crypto_box_seal.invokeExact(

            CLinker.toCString(message, StandardCharsets.US_ASCII, scope).address(),
            (long) message.length(),
            scope.allocateArray(C_CHAR, publicKey).address()
    );
    return cipherText.toByteArray();
}
----

There's a few thing to notice :

. I am specifically passing the `US_ASCII` charset, as I now that
the byte array representation of the string will be 1 byte per `char`, implying
I can use the `String::length` method.
If the string used characters that do not fit in a single byte, I would have
needed to extract the byte array using `UTF-8` charset encoder first and use
the length of the byte array instead.

. The `var ret` is not used, however due to the _dynamic_
nature of `invokeExact`, the compiler needs the *exact* signature on the
call-site, that's why the result of this invocation is assigned to an `int`
variable even if it is not used.
+
Without this assignment the JVM would have raised a `WrongMethodTypeException`,
in this case the exception message helps to identify the type differences
in the signature:
+

=== Ending the crypto box example

The last method call of this snippet ends the libsodium _crypto box_ example.
The method `crypto_box_seal_open` take pointers and a ciphered text length
so let's apply again what has been done for `crypto_box_seal`.

                              MemoryAddress.class, // public key
                              MemoryAddress.class  // secret key

I didn't get why this code failed at first.

`CLinker::toJavaString` is the mirror function of the `CLinker::toCString`, so it looked correct.

The exception message indicates the segment has the size 20 which is the length
of the string `Hello foreign code !`, there's `new offset is 20` indicating the
segment was read up to the 20th byte / character, and there is the `new length = 1`,
which suggests `toJavaString` needs to read an additional character but can't.

The javadoc of `toJavaString` says (emphasis is mine) :

> *Converts a null-terminated C string* stored at given address into a Java string, using the platform's default charset.

This immediately clicked: libsodium's _message_ does not imply it is a string.
It's API takes a pointer to a memory region and the length to read in that memory
region. For all that matter, the message could be any binary payload.

Let's look at the string `Hello`

. Libsodium _seal_ method will be passed the following byte array
`CLinker.toCString("Hello", StandardCharsets.US_ASCII).toByteArray()` => `48656C6C6F00`
. But since the code is using `String::length`, libsodium will only seal up to 5 bytes : `48656C6C6F`.
. Then _opening the seal_, the content of the `MemorySegment` that contains the decrypted message
will be `48656C6C6F`
. But `CLinker.toJavaString(decipheredText, StandardCharsets.US_ASCII)` expects
the memory segment to be a valid C string, terminated by the `\0` character. And since
the actual decrypted memory segment is not terminated by '\0', the code emit an error.

For this reason this suggests the code to use is
`new String(decipheredText.toByteArray(), StandardCharsets.US_ASCII)`. They are other
possibilities like not using the `CLinker::toCString` with the `crypto_box_seal`
method and instead, or to increment by 1 the length when `CLinker::toCString`
is passed.

For reference here are the bytes returned by `String::getBytes` and
`CLinker::toCString`.

* `"Hello".getBytes(US_ASCII)` => `48656C6C6F`
* `CLinker.toCString("Hello", US_ASCII).toByteArray()` => `48656C6C6F00`

For this blog post I'd like to keep the assumption the sealed message is a `String`,
which leads to the following correct code :

[source, java]
----
try (var scope = NativeScope.unboundedScope()) {
    var decipheredText = scope.allocateArray(C_CHAR, cipherText.length - crypto_box_sealbytes());
    var ret = (int) crypto_box_seal_open.invokeExact(decipheredText.address(),
                                                     scope.allocateArray(C_CHAR, cipherText).address(),
                                                     (long) cipherText.length,
                                                     scope.allocateArray(C_CHAR, publicKey).address(),
                                                     scope.allocateArray(C_CHAR, secretkey).address());

    return new String(decipheredText.toByteArray(), StandardCharsets.US_ASCII);
}
----

Also, I have intentionally left out the returned status of `crypto_box_seal_open`,
to focus on the foreign module API, but this would make sense to perform checks
on the returned value before returning the buffer as suggested on the libsodium
documentation.



=== Wrap up on manually using the Foreign Linker API

I didn't cover everything this API has to offer, like the _up call_ stubs,
which is a way to pass a function pointer to the native code, nor did I cover
the every feature of JEP-389, like `MemorySegment` or `MemoryLayout` API.

At this time I find this API a pleasure to use compared to JNI. Note that
I don't have experience with JNA, so I may be lacking perspective there.

There's a few pitfalls like the `CLinker::toJavaString` or the
`MemorySegment` lifecycles which get more complicated if those segments
are shared between threads. I found the API well-designed and well
documented, but if you're novice in this area, you'll likely need
other materials. A package wide documentation, in `jdk.incubator.foreign`,
should definitely fill this gap in my opinion.

The chosen example was concise in native code, but writing the stubs in Java
is quickly tedious and verbose. JDK developers felt the same way as they
are also investing energy on a tool named `jextract` whose goal is to reduce
the tedious work amount. I'll show in a section below what can be done with
the current state of `jextract`.

== Remarks about ``MemorySegment``s  memory mapping


``MemorySegment`` do have the same constraints as ``DirectByteBuffer``s,
ie by default the size of the segment can't size can't go over
`Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()`

.Allocating a very bigger segment than than `maxMemory`
[source]
----
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Cannot reserve 2147483648 bytes of direct buffer memory (allocated: 8192, limit: 522190848)
----

This limit is configurable by setting the `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize={size}` flag.

[source, java]
----
var memorySegment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(nativeSegmentSize);
----


There's one interesting thing with this API it is possible to access the address
from the API, via `MemorySegment::address`, and one can bet the hexadecimal
representation, via `Long.toHexString(memorySegment.address().toRawLongValue())`.

.MemoryAddress::toString
[source]
----
MemoryAddress{ base: null offset=0x7fc513fff010 }
----

If you are on Linux then you use `pmap` from the _procps_ package to
inspect memory mappings of the JVM.

<1> This is the allocated segment, 2 GiB <==> 2097152 KiB, this segment is a bit
larger by one page (4 KiB). And in fact the base address of the segment is
`0x7fc513fff010`.

In this case it is not related to alignment, but it may be possible. What is
important is that the address of a `MemorySegment` may be contained in a larger
memory mapping.

One important and useful distinction with ``DirectByteBuffer``s is the presence
of a `MemorySegment::close` method, that will *immediately free the native mapping*
when called.
``DirectByteBuffer`` used to be challenging because they had no explicit method
to free the native mapping, and as such had to wait for the GC to kick in
order to be freed.

.Initilization
Another thing to remind is that the memory mapping is zeroed, that means
a big segment will take a noticeable time to get initialized. As with
``DirectByteBuffer``s this pattern is interesting when inspecting off-heap memory.

.Scope
Usually it is more practical to use the `NativeScope` API as it is easier to
reason about boundaries of the involved memory mapping.
Using a larger `MemorySegment` coud be interesting when it has to be sliced and
shared among various threads. Also given the high initialization cost for large
segments it's likely to have the same lifecycle as the application.
Typically, in a few years, Netty, Aeron, Kafka, Cassandra, ...
could make use of this API !

.Slices
One thing that caught me off-guard, is that when closing a _slice_ (created by
`MemorySegment::asSlice`) also closes the underlying segment.

.Multiple allocations
Finally, when the code requires new native allocation, the JVM appears to be able to
grow native mappings. In short the JVM tries to put these segment in a bigger
memory mapping.

.Access modes
The access modes allows to define a set of _permissions_ of the `MemorySegment`,
by default all permissions are given. In the example below this segment won't
be readable by

[source,java]
----
var ms = MemorySegment.allocateNative(segmentSize)
                      .withAccessModes(MemorySegment.WRITE | MemorySegment.CLOSE);

ms.asByteBuffer().getLong(); <1>
----
<1> Throws UnsupportedOperationException: Required access mode READ ; current access modes: [WRITE, CLOSE]

I am not quite sure how to use these at this time. It certainly would be useful
to prevent a slice from being closed though.

Also, the `WRITE` and `READ` permissions only apply to the Java object, the
native memory mapping isn't afected, which is expected since it can hold multiple
`MemorySegment`.


.From a file
Until JEP-389, we used a `FileChannel` and a `MappedByteBuffer` to memory map a
file. The JEP-389 also take care of this use case, by using the `mapFile` factory
method.

[source, java]
----
try (var mmaped = MemorySegment.mapFile(
    path, // <1>
    0, // <2>
    Files.size(path), // <3>
    FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY // <4>
)) {
  // ...
}
----
<1> A path eg Path.of("...")
<2> The base offset
<3> The size of the mapping, here the complete file
<4> The mapping mode

What is really nice here is that the `MemorySegment` is also immediately freed
when the code leaves the try-with-resources block.


== JEP-389 is still incubating

I mentioned that `MemorySegment` is implementing `AutoCloseable`, it won't be
the case in the next JDK release.
In the same manner I mentioned `NativeScope` earlier, which is a JDK16 API, but
in the current panama state it will be replaced by a slightly different
construct.

[source, java]
----
try (ResourceScope scope : ResourceScope.ofConfined()) {
  MemorySegment.allocateNative(layout, scope):
  MemorySegment.mapFile(… , scope);
  CLinker.upcallStub(… , scope);
}
----

Given the current state I have doubts JEP-389 will get out of incubating
for JDK 17. JEP-389 is working well, but I think the developers may need more
time to get this API right. They are doing a fantastic job in my opinion.


== `jextract`

`jextract` is still being backed and was not ready to be included in JDK 16
for incubation, but since it complements JEP-389, I wanted to give
it a try and showcase its usefulness.

This tool leverages the native `libclang` and as such the `jdk.incubator.foreign`
module.

In order to be able to use it, one should download the panama jdk
here: https://jdk.java.net/panama/. Don't be scared by _early access_,
JDK 17 (very early at this stage) or the other warnings, you just need
to use `jextract` not the panama jdk.

When I started to bootstrap work on JDK16 and libsodium, the built
panama JDK didn't contain the `jextract`, as I wasn't sure
I voiced https://twitter.com/bricedutheil/status/1361086142402199554?s=21[this on Twitter],
Oracle engineers confirmed me this was a bug in the release
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8261733[JDK-8261733] if this every
happen again, or you want to try the latest `jextract`, you'll need to build
the panama JDK.

CAUTION: Again the `jextract` tool is still being backed at this time.
That means it that everything below can be obsolete any time.

=== Extracting Java liking code from the Libsodium headers

The first thing I need is to get the headers of libsodium, and for that
I cloned the repo. Then checked out the 1.0.18 tag as I intend to target
this released binary.

.Get the libsodium source
[source, shell]

Headers are located in this folder `src/libsodium/include`. Now let use
`jextract`.

<3> Indicates the target package of the generated source
<4> Includes of the library (some files include others in the library)
<5> Only includes symbols from the given file, otherwise symbols of
other includes may be extracted
<6> The C header file

Obviously the standard C headers are not discovered by `jextract`.
I tried to solve this by declaring the system includes in `/usr/include`
and `/usr/include/linux` (`/usr/include/linux/stddef.h`) but the error
went a bit further with `unknown type name 'size_t'`. This is a known issue
that for some platforms jextract has issues to find the system headers
(https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8262127[JDK-8262127]).

`size_t` is a standard C alias representing the _unsigned integer type_.
I found help in this https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@tomcat.apache.org/msg129346.html[old thread from november 2018].
Instead of using the includes under `/usr/includes`, it is necessary to use
the includes of the compiler ; on my docker image they were located
here : `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/8/include`.

Also I noticed that `jextract` generates classes first, but you can pass
a `--source` option to configure it to generate sources instead.


On the next run of `jextract` the `extraction` process stopped on
the file `version.h`.

In the libsodium repository there's a file named `version.h.in`,

a preliminary phase in the libsodium build will generate the final `version.h`.
In native sources this usually happen via a combination of `./autogen.sh`
and `./configure`.

Let's prepare the code base.

When I explicitly filtered on `sodium.h`, `jextract` evicted symbols
of the includes.

How to keep the declarations of the other headers ?
At this time `jextract` help is a bit vague.

that it's possible to pass multiple filters (`--filter`), just like it
is possible to pass multiple include (`-I`).
Although it is not very practical with multiple values, isn't is
possible to pass a pattern ?

This is answered here in this document
(https://github.com/openjdk/panama-foreign/blob/bedc58a3c967ea05ffdc0d5ec141e10e43faaf01/doc/panama_jextract.md[Using the `jextract` tool])

it's possible to pass `--filter` a part of the path, the current
code will just verify if this string is contained in the header path.

Concretely I can use the string `sodium` as a filter to include headers
located in `include/sodium/` folder.

=== Invoking the library

Let's have a look at what `jextract` generated. The entry point is
the class `sodium_h`. In particular let's compare the method stubs
to these I wrote earlier :

* `crypto_box_sealbytes`
* `crypto_box_keypair`
* `crypto_box_seal`
* `crypto_box_seal_open`

The libsodium headers declare a method named `crypto_box_sealbytes`,
whose role is to return a constant `crypto_box_SEALBYTES`, however
this constant is defined as a C preprocessor directive `#DEFINE`,
which is not visible as a symbol when performing a _library lookup_.
The native `crypto_box_sealbytes` method compensates this limitation.

`jextract` is however reading the headers, in doing so it actually extracts
the constant `crypto_box_SEALBYTES`. It is still exposed as method,
and it is declared in a different class `sodium_h_0#crypto_box_SEALBYTES`.

Note that `sodium_h` extends `sodium_h_0`, so one will write

[source, java]
----
sodium_h.crypto_box_SEALBYTES()
----

Behind the scene this call invokes `sodium_h_constants_1#crypto_box_SEALBYTES`,
and for `sodium_h` this split in two classes due to the class limits.
`sodium_h_constants_1` extends `sodium_h_constants_0`.

----

The stacktrace points to this code:

.sodium_h_constants_0.LIBRARIES
[source, java]
----
static final LibraryLookup[] LIBRARIES = RuntimeHelper.libraries(new String[] {
    "sodium", <1>
});
----
<1> This is the value I passed to the `jextract` command.

`RuntimeHelper::libraries` can load a library from a name (using JNI conventions,
https://github.com/openjdk/jdk16u/blob/1cc98bde6703d330b07ae873770df2c369b47eb2/src/hotspot/os/posix/include/jvm_md.h#L47-L55[`JNI_LIB_PREFIX` and `JNI_LIB_PREFIX`])
or a path.

The value above is the value I used in the `-l sodium` option of `jextract`,
yet this value here is obviously incorrect for my use case.

.Work around 1: with `jextract`
It is not yet clear, in the `jextract` usage description at this time,
but one can pass to the `-l` option

. A library name, which has to be available on one of the paths declared in the
JVM system property `java.library.path`
+
====
linux:: `/usr/java/packages/lib:/usr/lib64:/lib64:/lib:/usr/lib`

macOs:: `/Users/bric3/Library/Java/Extensions:/Library/Java/Extensions:/Network/Library/Java/Extensions:/System/Library/Java/Extensions:/usr/lib/java:.`
====
+
The library must conform to JNI conventions, `libsodium.23.dylib` or `libtasn1.so.6.5.5`
won't work as they contain version numbers.
. Or an absolute path eg `/usr/local/opt/libsodium/lib/libsodium.23.dylib`.

However, the actual library path is dependent on the system, on the library
version and on the installation mechanism. I could have used `jextract`
with `-l /usr/local/opt/libsodium/lib/libsodium.23.dylib`, but then the generated
code can not run on Linux without modifications, etc.

My final objective for this code is to declare the libsodium bindings in java,
and link with the actual libsodium on the platform macOs or Linux.

.Work-around 2: Modify generated code
`LIBRARIES` is a static final variable that is used by other static variables
in the same class. While it is possible to edit the `sodium_h_constants_0`
class, it is still difficult to make this `LibraryLookup` code configurable
without a significant refactoring.

Oracle engineers are aware of this problem https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8262126[JDK-8262126],
so we might see it fixed in the final JEP-389 release.

For this article the easiest solution, is to declare the local libsodium path
in the code, as I did in the first section of this blog.


[source, java]
----
static final LibraryLookup[] LIBRARIES = RuntimeHelper.libraries(new String[] {
    "/usr/local/opt/libsodium/lib/libsodium.23.dylib"
});
----

In the end I'll rework this initialization later though with custom code
to find the actual libsodium on the current platform.



==== Now implementing the other functions

Now let's profit from the generated function call, in the same order
I'd like to use `crypto_box_keypair`, this is straightforward.
The arguments are still _carrier_ type like `MemorySegment`,
which means we still need to take care of the scope / lifecycle of
these allocations.

.crypto_box_keypair
[source, java]
----
try (var scope = NativeScope.unboundedScope()) {
    var recipientPublicKey = scope.allocate(sodium_h.crypto_box_PUBLICKEYBYTES());
    var recipientSecretKey = scope.allocate(sodium_h.crypto_box_SECRETKEYBYTES());
    sodium_h.crypto_box_keypair(recipientPublicKey, recipientSecretKey); <1>
    return new CryptoBoxKeyPair(
            recipientPublicKey.toByteArray(),
            recipientSecretKey.toByteArray()
    );
}
----
<1> the _jextracted_ method

The IDE might suggest a method named `crypto_box_keypair$MH` ; the suffix
`$MH` simply indicates this returns the **M**ethod **H**andle for this native
method which is basically what I showed in the first part of this blog post.

As reflex, I always like to navigate the code I'm invoking.
The method we are invoking are just the public API methods, checking null,
and declaring a correct callsite (correct return type, correct argument types).

.sodium_h.crypto_box_keypair
[source, java]
----
public static  MethodHandle crypto_box_keypair$MH() {
    return RuntimeHelper.requireNonNull(sodium_h_constants_0.crypto_box_keypair$MH(),
                                        "unresolved symbol: crypto_box_keypair");
}
public static int crypto_box_keypair ( Addressable pk,  Addressable sk) {
    var mh$ = RuntimeHelper.requireNonNull(sodium_h_constants_0.crypto_box_keypair$MH(),
                                           "unresolved symbol: crypto_box_keypair");
    try {
        return (int)mh$.invokeExact(pk.address(), sk.address());
    } catch (Throwable ex$) {
        throw new AssertionError("should not reach here", ex$);
    }
}
----

Going further down to see how the `MethodHandle` is declared:

.sodium_h_constants_0.crypto_box_keypair$MH
[source, java]
----
static final FunctionDescriptor crypto_box_keypair$FUNC_ = FunctionDescriptor.of(
    C_INT,
    C_POINTER,
    C_POINTER
);

static final MethodHandle crypto_box_keypair$MH_ = RuntimeHelper.downcallHandle(
    LIBRARIES,
    "crypto_box_keypair",
    "(Ljdk/incubator/foreign/MemoryAddress;Ljdk/incubator/foreign/MemoryAddress;)I", <1>
    crypto_box_keypair$FUNC_, false
);
static final java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle crypto_box_keypair$MH() { return crypto_box_keypair$MH_; }
----
<1> Note that the Java method signature is declared with a String instead
of the Java API `MethodType`.

This code invokes creates the down-call stub, the only difference with the
handcrafted handle in the section above, is the signature of the method declared
as a `String`.

.`(Ljdk/incubator/foreign/MemoryAddress;Ljdk/incubator/foreign/MemoryAddress;)I` breakdown
- `Ljdk/incubator/foreign/MemoryAddress` => arg0
- `Ljdk/incubator/foreign/MemoryAddress` => arg1
- `I` => `int` return type

The other two methods in this example  `crypto_box_seal` and `crypto_box_seal_open`
are similar and don't require to do the tedious handle declaration.


This type raised a few questions about how to map them in Java in the first section
where I used manually `jdk.incubator.foreign`. Also there's statement at this time
about `jextract` not supporting some wide types.

> * jextract does not support certain C types bigger than 64 bits (e.g. `long double`).

How does it handle these unsupported types, the answer is in the source code.

In here we learn that unsigned types are represented with their signed counterpart and
the types wider than 64 bits are represented with a specific _unsupported_ layout
during headers processing. The symbols with unsupported layouts won't be generated
as the JEP-389 linker won't be able to link them.

.Some details on how ``jextract``'s primitive types handling
[%collapsible]

The enum below in jextract show how native primitive types are mapped to their
respective memory layout whether they are supported of not.

    /**

    /**
     * {@code wchar} type.
     */
    WChar("wchar_t", UnsupportedLayouts.WCHAR_T);
----

Those types can be _qualified_, in particular integer types can be unsigned:

.jdk.internal.jextract.impl.TypeMaker#makeTypeInternal
[source, java]
----
case UShort: {
    Type chType = Type.primitive(Primitive.Kind.Short);
    return Type.qualified(Delegated.Kind.UNSIGNED, chType);
}
case UInt: {
    Type chType = Type.primitive(Primitive.Kind.Int);
    return Type.qualified(Delegated.Kind.UNSIGNED, chType);
}
case ULong: {
    Type chType = Type.primitive(Primitive.Kind.Long);
    return Type.qualified(Delegated.Kind.UNSIGNED, chType);
}
case ULongLong: {
    Type chType = Type.primitive(Primitive.Kind.LongLong);
    return Type.qualified(Delegated.Kind.UNSIGNED, chType);
}
case UChar: {
    Type chType = Type.primitive(Primitive.Kind.Char);
    return Type.qualified(Delegated.Kind.UNSIGNED, chType);
}
----

Going further we can see that signed and unsigned integers use the same
memory layout, eg. `long long` and `unsigned long long` use the same layout
`C_LONG_LONG`.

<1> `C_LONG_LONG` will be used for both `long long` and `unsigned long long`.

jextract identify unsupported types, and represents them correctly during the C
header processing. But the symbols that use them will be skipped during the
Java generation.

=== Wrapping up on `jextract`

In the end `jextract` is useful but there's a few little hiccups along the way.
The generated code is currently lacking in some usability. Also, the generated
code is a tad verbose, I would wish a way to eliminate some unneeded generated
methods. Using `jextract` is a bit obscure as well, and they are a few pitfalls
there too, and may require peeking at the `jdk.incubating.jextract` source code
(in the panama repository).

While I mention these point, this should not diminish the work done on this tool
and what this tool could become. When ready, this could be leveraged by Gradle,
or Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA, etc.

== Closing words

.Cool part
In JDK16 the foreign module is really easy to use albeit `javac` and `java`
command line requirement. The API is well-designed and easy to use.
I also appreciated the idea of scoped segments, a bit like what was
implemented in the Rust language. There's also the coolness of being able
to free memory segment at will, without depending on the GC.

.Sad part
This is the third incubator and there's still planned API. Some of this
blog post content will eventually become incorrect when JDK17 comes out.
`jextract` looks like a very practical tool, yet it is still
being _cooked_.

.Overall
JEP-389 looks like solid replacement of JNI or JNA. I can only applaud the work
done! My only regret is it's not yet _already_ available. That said as a
developer I support the idea to not ship until ready.
