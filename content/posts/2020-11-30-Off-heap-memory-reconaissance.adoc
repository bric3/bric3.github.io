_This entry has been marinating for most of the year 2020. Rewriting it multiple
times to make it more digestible form, I've left out some content, but this is
still a big piece to read._

.tl;dr
****
* JVM Native Memory Tracking values are different from the RSS
* NMT is useful to identify the JVM runtime memory usage
* NMT does not track memory mapped files
* NMT does not track allocations performed by native libraries
* More threads means more memory usage (times the stack depth of the application)
* `pmap` or `/proc/{pid}/maps` (or `smap`) completes the picture
about effective RSS of every memory segment of the process
* In containers, evaluate the usage of `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch`, it
is easier to reason about _off-heap_ usage

Read on to get the details. Some sections are collapsed, typically
the snippets written in C.
****

== Motivation

I have been running applications in containers for a while now, and I have
noted that this shift in deployment resulted in tighter constraints. And the
closer the walls are the more we, software developers (or anyone involved in
production), should pay attention to how memory is consumed.

Indeed, sometime getting the right memory limit for Java applications is sometimes an
intangible task, and I think the
link:/2020/10/27/maxrampercentage-is-not-what-i-wished-for/[`MaxRAMPercentage` flag is certainly not the right tool for this job].

Moreover, with a given limit, if an application gets _OOM Killed_ then
one has to ask if it is the limit that needs adjustment or if it is the
application that is misbehaving (memory leak in particular, but not always).

To answer questions about memory usage there are various things to look at,
Java Heap, Metaspace other JVM components, etc. I faced a few incidents,
where the JVM settings and the Kubernetes memory limit were seemingly
appropriate, yet the apps were constantly _OOM Killed_ because the RSS kept
growing toward this limit. Some of these issues have been solved just
by raising the memory limit. However, in some other cases it wasn't that
crystal clear.

This served as excuse to go down the rabbit hole.

This entry will hopefully help to understand the basics of how a
`java` process uses native memory and remind some rudiments of OS
memory management.

Most of the time, figures will use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix[IEC binary notation] (`1 KiB = 1024 Byte`),
it matches the https://github.com/corretto/corretto-11/blob/055a9a1a279b9a2953c2150bc937b04f905eeba1/src/src/hotspot/share/utilities/globalDefinitions.hpp#L226[JVM],
our https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory[Kubernetes] usage,
and Linux's tools (`/proc/{pid}/stat` or `/proc/{pid}/maps` ; although I couldn't find a reference link stating this).

Some charts may however use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix[SI metric notation] (`1 KB = 1000 Byte`).

[quote, Java Performance: The Definitive Guide, Getting the Most Out of Your Code (1st Edition)]
Actually, 227,893 KB is only 222 MB. For ease of discussion, I'll truncate the KBs part by 1,000
in this chapter; pretend I'm a disk manufacturer.

NOTE: Also, all java snippet and command have been run with Java 11.

NOTE: Last one, this writing assume the cgroups *v1*, the v2 have slight
variation that I haven't studied yet.

Getting comfortable with the memory of a (JVM) process is a tedious task
for most of us that wrote code in Java for their entire professional life.
However, this is a rewarding task, and it's possible to extract useful
findings.



== Exploration begins

=== The JVM flags as a starting point

When assessing java memory, one of the fist thing to look at are the Java heap parameters.

It's likely anyone that reads this article is familiar with `Xms` or `Xmx`, but there are
other ways to define the boundaries of the Java heap in particular if the process is started
with `\*RAMPercentage`. With these the JVM will compute the actual values from the `cgroup`,
in this case it's possible to access the actual runtime values with `jcmd`.

In short, it's possible to look at the command line options, but using the diagnostic
command `jcmd {pid} VM.flags` lets you peek at the actual values that the JVM used.

For example with a memory limit of `5 GiB`, if a process is started with
`-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=85.0 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=85.0` the `VM.flags`
diagnostic command will output this :

.JVM current flags in a kubernetes container
[source, shell]
----
$ jcmd $(pidof java) VM.flags | tr ' ' '\n'
6:
...
-XX:InitialHeapSize=4563402752 <3>
-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=85.000000 <1>
-XX:MarkStackSize=4194304
-XX:MaxHeapSize=4563402752 <4>
-XX:MaxNewSize=2736783360
-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=85.000000 <2>
-XX:MinHeapDeltaBytes=2097152
-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary
...
----
<1> Initial RAM at 85%
<2> Max RAM at 85%
<3> Initial heap size ~`4.25 GiB`
<4> Max heap size ~`4.25 GiB`

TIP: Do not confuse the `VM.flags` command which will output parameters calculated *from* the
_command line_ and `VM.command_line` which will print the *raw* _command line_.

The other Hotspot flag values comes are JVM _defaults_, which may either be static values,
or computed from internal heuristics.

As we tend to dismiss regularly, the Java heap is only a part of the process memory usage.
So now let's dig into how memory is _consumed_. The values or snippet comes from an
application running inside a container.





=== The real memory footprint of the java process in the container

The JVM is doing everything to keep software developers from caring about
memory, and before containers the bigger systems helped to sustain this
comfortable way of programming. Sometime there's a Java heap memory leak
but it doesn't happen every day, and even more remotely there's a problem
with the process memory.

There's more chance we could get hit by GC pauses.

With containers, one of the most critical things to look at is the _resident set size_,
that's the native memory, it can be obtained in various ways, using `ps`, `top` or
reading the `/proc` filesystem. E.g. on the same application on which
I got the flags above:

.`ps`
[source, role="primary"]
----
$ ps o pid,rss -p $(pidof java)
PID   RSS
  6 4701120
----

.`/proc/{pid}/status`
[source, role="secondary"]
----
$ cat /proc/$(pgrep java)/status | grep VmRSS
VmRSS:	 4701120 kB
----

The RSS is `4.6 GiB`, and it's Java heap size is `4.25 GiB`, indicating
this process uses around `0.35 GiB` of non-Java heap memory, I'll refer
to this memory as _native memory_.

I'd like to dig a bit to understand the reported number `4701120 KiB`,
what it actually measures.






==== The JVM component memory

In order to understand how the Java process memory is consumed, we need to use
_Native Memory Tracking_ (`-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary`) which produces
an overview of the memory usage by the _components of the JVM_. It actually gives
a pretty good picture of the "cost" of having a JVM.

NOTE: Enabling _detailed_ native memory tracking (NMT) causes a 5% to 10%
performance overhead. The _summary_ mode merely has an impact in memory usage
as shown below and is usually enough.

NOTE: It is necessary to note that while the above command indicate a scale
in `KB` for the JVM it really means `KiB`.

<1> This shows a `reserved` value (`7168324 KiB` (~`6.84 GiB`)), it's the amount
of addressable memory on that container, and a `committed` value (`4456448 KiB` (~`4.25 GiB`))
that represents what the JVM actually asked the OS to allocate.
<2> `Heap` zone, note that reserved and committed values are the same `4456448 KiB`
here because our `InitialRAMPercentage` is the same as max. I'm not sure why this number
is different from the VM flags `-XX:MaxHeapSize=4563402752` though.
<3> ~`162 MiB` of metaspace.
<4> How many classes have been loaded : `28431`.
<5> There are 674 threads whose stacks are using ~`80 MiB` at this time.
<6> `Code` cache area (assembly of the used methods) ~`102 MiB` out of ~`246 MiB`.
<7> This section contains `GC` algorithms internal data structures, this is app
is using G1GC which takes ~`225 MiB`.
<8> C1 / C2 compilers (which compile bytecode to assembly) use ~`5.8 MiB`.
<9> The `Symbol` section contains many things like interned strings and other
internal constants for about `28.2 MiB`.
<10> The `Internal` area takes ~`24 MiB`. Before Java 11 this area included
`DirectByteBuffers`, but from Java 11 those are accounted in the `Other` zone.
<11> The `Other` section after Java 11 includes `DirectByteBuffers` ~`261 MiB`.

The remaining areas are much smaller in scale, NMT takes ~`8.2 MiB`
itself, module system usage ~`1.3 MiB`, etc. Also, note that enabling
other JVM features may show up if they are activated, like flight recorder.

*In the rest of this article when talking the context of Native Memory Tracking
I may use the terms _memory type_ or _memory zones_, but the real definition would be :*

> *the _memory allocation type_ performed by a _JVM component_*

The different sections are defined there in
https://github.com/corretto/corretto-11/blob/caa2f4cad666b508a88b92db01054ace8647a820/src/src/hotspot/share/memory/allocation.hpp#L114-L141[this `MemoryType` enumeration],

as they appear in the report.

_NMT_ is a great tool to gain an insight on the memory usage of the various
parts that compose the Java runtime. It has interesting subcommands to compare
the memory usage of the JVM components with a _baseline_
(`jcmd $(pidof java) VM.native_memory baseline`, followed at some point by
one or several `jcmd $(pidof java) VM.native_memory summary.diff`).


This is very useful for JVM components and a good complement to what I would
like to show in this article, because NMT alone *does not answer
what is actually accounted in the RSS column of `ps`*.







==== Revising OS virtual memory and memory management

I mentioned this acronym already, _RSS_ or **R**esident **S**et **S**ize,
what is it? What exactly means _committed_ memory or _reserved_ memory
reported in _NMT_ ? How do they relate to each other?

First let's break down the vocabulary when we talk about memory.

.vocabulary breakdown (https://stackoverflow.com/a/31178912/48136[source])
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===

| *Committed* | Address ranges that have been mapped or ``malloc``ed.
They may or may not be backed by physical or swap due to lazy allocation
and paging. This applies to the JVM and the OS. These ranges are actually
not necessarily contiguous.

| *Reserved* | The total address range that has been pre-mapped via `mmap`
or `malloc` for a particular memory pool. In other words _reserved memory_
represents the maximum addressable memory.
Those could be referred to as *uncommitted*.

| *Resident* | OS memory pages which are currently in physical ram. This means
code, stacks, part of the committed memory pools but also portions of ``mmap``ed
files which have recently been accessed and allocations outside the control of
the JVM.

| *Virtual* | The sum of all virtual address mappings. Covers committed, reserved
memory pools but also mapped files or shared memory. This number is rarely informative
since the JVM will reserve large address ranges upfront. We can see this number
as the pessimistic memory usage.

|===


The above graph mostly displays the relative size by memory _kind_
within the address space of a process. In order to explain _resident_ memory
it's necessary to revise how Linux (and other OSes by the way) manage
memory using the concept of *paging*.

The virtual address space is divided into smaller chunks called _pages_
usually of `4 KiB`.
_There are other page sizes and these sizes may even co-exist (e.g. having pages of
4 KiB mixed with 2 MiB pages), it depends on the capabilities
of the processor ; working with different size of pages is something that is out
of scope for this article.
What is interesting is how paging and RSS relate to each other._

The graph above shows the addressable space of a process and its _pages_.
The process can access these pages using the addresses of its virtual space,
however these pages have to be stored physically, usually in RAM, sometime on disk.
When referring to these chunks of memory on hardware, we use the term _frame_.

The real memory address is naturally different from this virtual address space
for the process. In the CPU there's a specialized component called MMU (Memory
Management Unit) whose role is to translate the virtual addresses
to physical addresses.

The incentive behind virtual memory and paging comes from multi-tasking, it allows
running multiple program concurrently. Each process will have the illusion of a single
big block of memory. In practice, it abstracts away useful tricks like
lazy allocation, swapping, file mapping, defragmentation, caching, etc.

The OS is hard at work performing these tricks while keeping this illusion for all
processes. Since programs run concurrently, **not all memory pages is used at the
same time**.

In practical terms we can observe that:

* A _physical memory frame_ won't be used if the process didn't _touch_ a page, or
we can say this page doesn't exist.

* The kernel may choose to move the content of a page to a slower
device, usually a disk in a special place called _swap_ if it thinks there
won't be enough physical memory (RAM).

* The kernel may use unemployed physical frames for caching purpose, or other tasks
like defragmentation.

The _resident set size_ mean the total set of pages of a process, i.e. without
untouched / unused pages.
This contrasts with virtual size which includes the total address space of
a program, this value is usually way superior to RSS.

_If you want to dive how the whole paging thing works head to
system courses, or articles (like https://landley.net/writing/memory-faq.txt[this masterpiece])
where they usually explain in depth how everything interacts._




===== Reserved and committed memory for NMT

//As mentioned above, one of the idea of the *reserved* / *committed* memory is to
//provide the illusion of a single *continuous* memory space.

Concretely for the JVM it means that

1. the _committed_ memory is immediately usable,
2. and the _reserved_ memory part means memory _put on hold_ and not immediately usable.

With a better understanding of how memory works let's look again at the output
of the `VM.native_memory` command to make more sense of it:

[source]

----
<1> The process addressable memory and what is currently committed.
<2> Here the NMT also show the same abstractions of committed and reserved memory,
on this process these values are the same because the `InitialHeapSize` (`Xms`) and
`MaxHeapSize` (`Xmx`)are the same. If these boundaries were different it is likely
the heap zone would show different values for reserved and committed memory; the
JVM will increase the committed memory if necessary, and can even uncommit some of
this memory if the GC algorithm allows it.
<3> Class, Code spaces works the same way, specifics JVM flags control the reserved
and committed memory.
<4> Java Threads are allocated within the process memory, the JVM flags only control
the size of a thread. I will expand on this later.
<5> Then comes the other memory space of the JVM, like the GC internal structures, who
are using a different memory management, these zones usually have the same reserved/committed
amount.

This graph bring the following definitions :

.Java memory vocabulary
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===

| *Used Heap* | The amount of memory occupied by live objects and to a certain
extent object that are unreachable but not yet collected by the GC. This only
relate to the JVM Java heap.

| *Committed heap* | The current limit if the writable memory to write objects to.
It's the current workspace of the GC. Upon JVM bootstrap this value should be equal
to `Xms`, then the GC may expand it up to the Java heap reserved memory, or in Java
terms the heap max size, or `Xmx`.

| *Heap Max Size* | The maximum amount of memory that the Java heap can occupy.
It's the _reserved_ amount in Java Heap section of the NMT output.
If the application requires more memory, this will result in a `OutOfMemoryError`.

|===


So committed stands for writable memory and, reserved stands for total addressable
space of the memory. How does it work concretely?

The JVM starts by https://github.com/corretto/corretto-11/blob/3b31d243a19774bebde63df21cc84e994a89439a/src/src/hotspot/os/linux/os_linux.cpp#L3421-L3444[_reserving_ the memory],
then parts of this "reserve" will be made available by
https://github.com/corretto/corretto-11/blob/3b31d243a19774bebde63df21cc84e994a89439a/src/src/hotspot/os/linux/os_linux.cpp#L3517-L3531[modifying the memory mappings]
using `malloc`, `mmap`, as well as `mprotect` calls in particular (on Linux).






===== `malloc` and `mmap`

The `malloc` and `mmap` C calls ask the OS to allocate memory. The OS will then
provide the application the necessary memory or report an error if it is not possible.

Also, depending on the mapping in particular for `mmap` the OS can be asked
to make a file accessible as a memory zone, in short it's the kernel that perform
IOs, in contrast to perform IOs with a file descriptor application side.

.Differences between https://linux.die.net/man/3/malloc[`malloc`] and http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/mmap.2.html[`mmap`]
[%collapsible]
====
* `malloc` may _recycle_ previously used memory that was released by `free`,
and perform a system call to get memory only required. It's part of the C standard.

* `malloc` allows you pass a size and that's basically it.

* `mmap` is a system call. It's not part of the C standard, and may not be available
on all platforms.

* `mmap` can both map private memory or shared memory (as in shared with other processes).
Those are called _anonymous mapping_ using flag `MAP_ANONYMOUS`.

* `mmap` can also interact with disk files on specific ranges, without having
a file descriptor.

* `mmap` can be set with various flags that are used to control how this memory
mapping behave.

* Both have their performance characteristics, `malloc` is usually preferred for
few and small allocations, `mmap` is preferred for few but large allocations.
====

When the JVM bootstrap, it requests a main memory of a certain size with the `PROT_NONE`
flag to prevent any access. This has the effect to tell the OS that this mapping should
not be backed by physical memory. Then when memory is needed by the program,
the JVM changes the mapping for a sub-range of that main memory by removing the
`PROT_NONE` flag. When new java threads are created, then the JVM will simply
request another memory segment.


.Simple C code example
[%collapsible]
====

To help you understand here's a very simple program:

. that *reserves* `16 MiB` via a `malloc` call and `16 MiB` via the `mmap` call
. then this program will invoke `ps` to show its actual memory consumption (RSS)
. then it will touch/use memory by setting a bit every `1 KiB`
. then this program will invoke `ps` again to show its actual memory consumption (RSS)

As the `stdout` shows the RSS of this program is very low until memory
is actually written to. At the same time the virtual memory is much,
much higher; it means this simple program could address up to
about `4 GiB`.

Now after some memory management refresh, let's go back to the main
topic of this blog post.






==== Exploring what NMT does not show

The previous section walked through the numbers reported, and that they
represent the sizes of the different JVM memory zones, but, does not
reveal the effective usage.


The JVM components can use different _types of memory management_ and
as such may have multiple allocation mechanisms. NMT reports
the different allocation types, for example:

. GC based
The `Java heap` and the `Metaspace` (`Class`) are usually the biggest consumers of memory,
they both rely on `mmap`.
+
.Java heap and metaspace
[source]
----
-                 Java Heap (reserved=3145728KB, committed=3145728KB)
                            (mmap: reserved=3145728KB, committed=3145728KB)

-                     Class (reserved=1195111KB, committed=164967KB)
                            (classes #27354)
                            (  instance classes #25689, array classes #1665)
                            (malloc=5223KB #86596)
                            (mmap: reserved=1189888KB, committed=159744KB)
----
+
These two _memory zones_ are interesting in that they are managed by the GC algorithm,
put in other words the GC is actually the memory manager of these zones, it is able to
_arrange_ the memory according to the options that are passed on the command line.
E.g. with a fixed size heap (`Xms` = `Xmx`), the heap will be constituted of a large memory
segment, in this case the _reserved_ and _committed_ values will be the same as well.
+
Other options may trigger specific behavior for these memory zones, e.g. make
the heap to grow or to shrink (I never saw that in practice,
maybe I'll see it once I use a JDK 12+ with _heap uncommit_ with https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/346[JEP-346],
although even the JEP mention it'll only happen if there is very low activity, which is unlikely to
happen for some workload).



. Threads
The Java threads are constructs controlled by the JVM runtime,
each thread is allocated on addressable space, their allocation size is always the
same, but can be controlled via a few JVM parameters. Their usage depends on
application usage. E.g. if the program request 1000 threads, then the JVM needs
to allocate 1000 threads.
+
.Thread

                            (malloc=1866KB #3103) <2>
                            (arena=605KB #1033) <3>
----
<1> The stack memory is where the JVM puts the thread stack, it's the sum

<2> The thread sub-system performed 3103 ``malloc`` calls amounting to `1866 KiB`.
<3> The thread local handles required 1033 arenas, amounting to `605 KiB`.


. Other native zones
The other component reported by NMT management uses different technics. Sometime using a
combination of these technics:
+
`GC` zone for example only works with `malloc` and `mmap`, and size can grow as needed.
+

The JVM also implements its own
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management[Arena based memory management],
(distinct from the arena memory management of glibc). It is used by some
subsystems of the JVM or when native code uses internal objects that rely on JVM arenas
https://github.com/corretto/corretto-11/blob/885a3859f47627467a15adaef36fd90ceb517f5e/src/src/hotspot/share/utilities/bitMap.hpp#L344-L345[[1\]]

`Compiler`, `Symbol table` do use this memory management for example.

<1> The compiler performed 3575 ``malloc`` calls amounting to `6533 KiB`.
<2> The compiler uses 5 arenas totaling `133 KiB`.



==== Track `DirectByteBuffer` with NMT

Using NMT `baseline` and `summary.diff` modes, it is possible to
track the evolution of the JVM components. ``DirectByteBuffer``s
allow allocating native memory segments. They are not cheap to create,
and they are only deallocated when a GC actually finalize the
references. Usually these byte buffers have a long life and
they are big.

The following snippet of code will try to show they are reported in the
`Other` section of NMT. Note that in this snippet I'm just invoking
the external process `jcmd` for brevity and clarity, but it's possible
to invoke the diagnostic command in pure Java.

it looks more like 4 buffers of `100 MiB`
<2> ``DirectByteBuffer``s use `malloc` underneath.
<3> This times there is also a reduction in the Java Heap.

As one can see the total reserved and committed memory are actually increased
by the amount of allocated memory.

The last exercise, `20 x 100 MiB`, is more captivating: the low amount of
allocated memory by ``DirectByteBuffer``s is simply explained by the GC
that kicked in, if run the last command with `-Xlog:gc*` you'll notice 4 Full GC
happening in the middle of the loop.

The above code don't keep strong references to the _wrapping_ buffers,
thus allowing these object to be GC__ed__, if the references of these
byte buffers were kept, this program would exited with a
`java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory`

It's not part of this article but it's well worth to understand 
how ``DirectByteBuffer``s handle their garbage collection (using a
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html[`Cleaner`]).

Now I mentioned that there was 4 Full GCs, that should have raised eyebrows.
If it didn't the full GC cause should provoke the attention, `System.gc()`.
Pretending I don't know where this came from I'll search where these are happening

By default, the VM limits the total size or capacity of direct byte buffers to
https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11u/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/jdk/internal/misc/VM.java#L114-L122[somewhat the size of the heap].
This can be tuned via `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize`. The 4 Full GC cycles indicate
for 20 allocateDirect() and 4 remaining, this means after 4 successful create the 5th allocateDirect
will require a System.gc(), this suggests a max memory limit in this range `[419430400;524288000[`,
and indeed the reported size of Java Heap section is `522190848` (`509952 KiB`).


==== Track memory mapped file with NMT

Using NMT `baseline` and `summary.diff` modes, is it possible to
track the memory mapped file usage? Let's try out.

    new ProcessBuilder("jcmd", Long.toString(ProcessHandle.current().pid()), "VM.native_memory", "baseline")
        .start()
        .waitFor();

    Path src = Paths.get("/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto/lib/src.zip"); // <1>
    try (var fileChannel = (FileChannel) Files.newByteChannel(src, StandardOpenOption.READ)) {

          FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY,
          0, // <2>
          fileChannel.size()); // <2>
      mappedByteBuffer.load(); // <3>

<1> Opens a binary file about `50 MiB` in size.
<2> Range of the memory mapping starts at `0`, up to the total file size.
<3> The `load` method will actually instruct the OS to load the range defined above
in resident memory.

Let's look at what NMT reports.

Nothing.

We'll see in a later section how to see how much memory mapped files
can account in the resident memory.

As a side note before switching to OS tooling, the memory segment
used for the memory mapping is not freed until the next GC cycle.




==== Inspecting memory mappings

It's easy to get the RSS of a process, to understand if the committed
heap actually _resides_ on physical memory you need to use `pmap` or inspect
`/proc/{pid}/maps` or `/proc/{pid}/smaps`.

The `pmap` binary is part of the https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/[`procps`]
utilities, that contains other tools like: `ps`, `pgrep`, `watch` or `vmstat`.
It's likely that no additional installation is required which is great as
a container filesystem should be read-only for security reasons, if it isn't
there, one could still look at the `/proc` filesystem.


You have to notice one of the first memory zones is quite big and about
the size of the committed heap as shown in NMT.

To select the file mappings we can filter on the
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt[access permissions]:

* `r-`: readable memory mapping
* `w`: writable memory mapping
* `x`: executable memory mapping
* `s` or `p` : shared memory mapping or private mapping. `/proc/<pid>/maps`

[INFO]
=======
`pmap` may show another mapping mode which I barely found any
reference of, here's https://johanlouwers.blogspot.com/2017/07/oracle-linux-understanding-linux.html[one]
and https://linux.die.net/man/2/mmap[here]

* `R`: if set, the map has no swap space reserved (`MAP_NORESERVE` flag of `mmap`).
This means that we can get a segmentation fault by accessing that memory if it has not
already been mapped to physical memory, and if the system is out of physical memory.
=======

There's also the value of the inode column, if it's greater than `0` then
it means the address range is backed by a file, if it's `0` it's a memory
allocation that the application has requested.


.Identifying JVM memory components
There are three kinds of memory segments we can easily guess in the memory
mapping reported by `pmap` because we know their size, it's the Java heap,
and the threads.

Some other type of allocations can be figured out but that's for another post.
The remaining address ranges are too difficult to guess for two reasons,
they usually have unpredictable allocation behavior, and it
also depends on the `malloc` implementation details, (like the
https://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/malloc/arena.c.html[arenas in Glibc]),
and on the number `malloc` calls for a single component.

On a pod running in production let's have a quick look on the very first mappings.
It's easier to spot with `pmap -X` (capital `X`).

<1> native heap memory heap
<2> java heap
<3> a thread guard pages
<4> a thread stack

The first thing to natice is that `pmap` choses to display the start address,
and the size of the mapping in another column, while the `maps` _file_ is using
address ranges. As you might have guessed, the sum of the size of these mapping
is the value one can see in the `vsz` column of `ps`.


.Explanation
. `740000000-801180000` (`3163648 KiB`), around `3 GiB` in a simple mapping,
this looks like the size of the heap, subtracting the addressed gives this number
`3 239 575 552`, which very close to the VM actual flag for the heap
`-XX:MaxHeapSize=3221225472`, the JVM must map additional space. We also note that
the RSS on this mapping is equal to the size, this means that either this flag
`-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch` is active, or that all pages in the heap have been touched once,
for this app this is the former case.
+
This single address range, also indicates that the minimum and the maximum value of
the heap is the same `Xmx` = `Xms`. If they weren't we would have seen two adjacent
segment with different permissions (`rw-p` then `---p`), the JVM can grow
the read-and-write segment of the Java Heap.
+
Just under this mapping there's another one `801180000-840000000` (`1030656 KiB`),
around `1 GiB`, one could think it's the metaspace, but it isn't. Looking at
the other columns, the mode or permissions or the RSS, we see respectively `---p`
and `0`, this means this memory segment is reserved but it is not writeable.
+
Finding the metaspace cannot be done this way.

. `55bac569c000-55bae13a2000`, on the extended `pmap` output this mapping has a name
`heap`, this one is the native java heap of the Java process.
One can notice the next mapping address (`7ff9b91e7000`) is not adjacent, this allows
the native heap to grow if necessary. The virtual size of this mapping is
`~445 MiB` and the active pages amounts to `428 MiB`.

. Then there's a lot of mapping with this pattern, first `16 KiB` with no permission (`---p`)
immediately followed by a `1012 KiB` segment with read and write permissions (`rw-p`), those
are the Java threads, by default the virtual size the of the thread stack size is `1 MiB`,
the `ThreadStackSize` flag control this maximum stack size.
+
The `16 KiB` are the thread guard pages, the number of pages (`4 KiB`) is controlled by
`StackReservedPages`, `StackYellowPages` and `StackRedPages` whose defaults are respectively
`1`, `2`, and `1`.
They are used when a stack overflow error happens, normally the guard pages cannot
be written to, their permission will change in order to handle the error ; read
https://pangin.pro/posts/stack-overflow-handling[this explanation] from https://twitter.com/apangin[Andrei Pangin] 
to learn more on this topic.
+
[NOTE]
====
For the keen observer the virtual size of these two memory segment is `1028 KiB`,
a bit more than `1 MiB`, I've learned a few months ago that
https://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/nptl/allocatestack.c.html#550[glibc], and other
allocators apparently adds one page to the allocated stack size, if the segment size is
https://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/sysdeps/i386/i686/stack-aliasing.h.html#23[a multiple of 64K].

This is to http://qcd.phys.cmu.edu/QCDcluster/intel/vtune/reference/64k_Aliasing_Conflicts.htm[prevent aliasing on the CPU cache lines]

> A 64K-aliasing conflict occurs when a virtual address memory references a cache line
> that is modulo 64K bytes apart from another cache line that already resides in the first
> level cache. Only one cache line with a virtual address modulo 64K bytes can reside
> in the first level cache at the same time.
>
> For example, accessing a byte at virtual addresses 0x10000 and 0x3000F would cause

====
+
In other words one can see an additional `4 KiB` (a page), for stack size like
`512 KiB`, `256 KiB`, `128 KiB`,`64 KiB`.
+
That being said, if pages in the mapping are not touched, they do not account as
resident memory. This `55bac569c000-55bae13a2000` mapping tells the stack was at most
`92 KiB`. Anyway with more threads there will be naturally more consumed resident
memory.


The other JVM components are harder to identify due to the way they are allocated.
That being said `pmap` reveals _file-backed_ memory mapping, these consumes pages too.


==== Inspecting memory mapped files

The `NativeMemoryTracking` output showed memory usage of the JVM, but it didn't report
`MappedByteBuffers`, those are the files that are _memory mapped_ to the virtual memory
of a process as explained above via the native `mmap` call.

There are two ways to read a file using a file descriptor, generally it happens when
opening a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/FileInputStream.html[`FileInputStream`],
or using memory mapping via a
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html[`FileChannel`].

When a file is memory mapped, the range of the content is divided by pages too, and
when accessed they are _copied_ in RAM by the OS, these are accounted in RSS.
For this reason they may deserve some attention if RSS usage is high but the app
memory alone is not enough.


The `Mapping` column on the of `pmap -x $(pgrep java)` can be parsed to identify
file mappings, but this is brittle and unnecessary, one can simply look at
the output of `pmap -X $(pgrep java)` (notice the big `X`) or even at the
`/proc/$(pidof java)/maps` content looking for a non-zero value of the `inode`
column meaning this mapping is file backed.

Using the output of `pmap -X $(pgrep java)` and selecting the matching lines
with `awk` this is _easy_:

// https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/116327/loading-of-shared-libraries-and-ram-usage
// https://manybutfinite.com/post/anatomy-of-a-program-in-memory/

What may catch the eye is the multiple mapping for native libraries like `libjvm.so`.
The reason for these different memory mapping is how dynamic libraries are loaded
(with `dlopen`, e.g. here https://github.com/corretto/corretto-11/blob/4e14d3399615085a1b4bc89bc5c06bfcb1a08279/src%2Fsrc%2Fhotspot%2Fos%2Flinux%2Fos_linux.cpp#L1947-L1966[os::Linux::dlopen_helper]).
I didn't have any system courses, but from what I believe I know https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen[`dlopen`]
will make multiple memory mapping with different objectives and permissions:

* `r-xp` means an executable segment of the library, probably the native execution stack
of the native library
* `r\--p` means readable memory of the library, I believe it is the library constants or symbols
* `rw-p` means writable memory, I think its purpose is for the main process to set global
variables of the library
*  `---p` is a no permission segment, I'm not sure about this one, but it's location
(between executable and writable segments) makes me think it's about buffer overflow
prevention

The program below will simply load the shared dynamic library `libjvm.so`,
and won't even interact with it. The result shows the 4 mappings
with the different modes.

In the above snippet the mapped files represents `195.3 MiB` of the address space
of which `52.3 MiB` are actually resident. This app is definitely OK. Some
application's workload require to handle a lot of files suggesting raising the limit
may be the right thing. I've seen in the past `FileChannel` unreleased mappings,
leading to increasing memory consumption that weren't easily identifiable in the Java heap
(unless you had to perform a heap dump and knew what to look at).


==== Inspecting the other segments

Going beyond what has been mentioned is a tad more intricate due
to how native code is performing allocations.
Even identifying direct `ByteBuffer` is almost impossible, the little program below
allocates 16 MiB segments and print the address of these memory segments, as well
as the current process mapping.

.DirectByteBuffers.main
[source, java]
----
System.out.printf("max: %d%n", Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory());

new ProcessBuilder("pmap", "-x", Long.toString(ProcessHandle.current().pid()))
        .redirectOutput(Redirect.INHERIT)
        .start()
        .waitFor();

var address = Buffer.class.getDeclaredField("address");
address.setAccessible(true);
System.out.printf("native heap (pmap shows [heap] mapping");
for (var i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    var byteBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(16 * 1024 * 1024)
            .putInt(0, 0x01);
    System.out.printf("%s%n", Long.toHexString(address.getLong(byteBuffer)));
}

new ProcessBuilder("pmap", "-x", Long.toString(ProcessHandle.current().pid()))
        .redirectOutput(Redirect.INHERIT)
        .start()
        .waitFor();
----


The mapping output _after_ the buffers have been ``malloc``ed shows
that the direct ``ByteBuffer``s do not have their own segment, they are
part of a bigger area.

{{< /wrapTable >}}

Here I can say those are likely our ``ByteBuffer``s, because I had the opportunity
to diff the `pmap` output around code that specifically created the new direct
buffers. Also, I know that direct ``ByteBuffer``s are __zero__ed, i.e. pages
are touched/dirty, i.e. direct byte buffers immediately count toward the RSS.

In a real application it's impossible to identify them with certainty without
the address. The possible criteria would be RSS and size are the same for the segment,
permissions are read write and of course it's anonymous mapping, but any other
allocation pattern or usage could meet these criteria.




Finally, if `pmap` is run with `-X` it's likely you'll notice segments named
`vsyscall` `vdso`, these are

==== How many pages are used ?

While not immediately useful, it's interesting that the displayed RSS value
by `ps` is in fact the number of page times the page size. (I suppose the
equation is a tad more complex than a single multiplication when huge pages
are involved).

For example in the https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt[procfs documentation]
(the latest, as in `latest` kernel, documentation is
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html[there]) gives the
description of the `statm` object.

a cgroup memory limit) of `6 GiB` (`6442450944 Bytes` ), a `java` process
is started with a bigger memory `-Xmx16g` that the cgroup limit, we can observe
that:

. a process can _over-commit_, if Linux is configured to allow this
(`/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`), this is not an issue as long as
. the memory used by the resident pages do not go over the cgroup limit.
. The process will be oom-killed if it uses more than `6442450944 / 4 = 1310720`

=== Paging and the Java heap

Before wrapping this article I'd like to mention an interesting effect of
virtual memory, over-commit and Java Heap.


The pages of the Java heap memory segment count if these pages have initialized
at least once, during the life of the program, the activity of the program and
the GC will increase the number of touched pages, pages that count in the RSS.

For G1GC
. New allocation will happen in a GC region called _Eden_, and more specifically
in a sub-segment called TLAB dedicated for the thread that perform the allocation.

. After some time the GC will kick in and move (or evacuate) the live objects to
GC region called _Survivor_.

. This cycle will go on until the object is considered old enough to be
evacuated to a GC region called _Old_.

After each evacuation, the regions that previously held the objects,
are cleaned up, and their bits set to `0`, but the page are still considered dirty
and count in the RSS. This region will return to a pool of _Free_ regions.

For the evacuation, the live objects can go to existing region if they have some
space or if there's not enough space in the existing regions, G1GC will
convert a _Free_ region to either a _Survivor_ or an _Old_ region. If the _Free_
region has been used before then no new pages will get dirty, however if the
_Free_ region has never been in use before then this will touch more pages.


image::/assets/off-heap-recon/gc-regions-untouched-pages.svg[align="center", title="GC regions usage of pages"]


This can lead to a situation if the Java heap is large enough, where
many never-used-before _Free_ region exists. In this situation
it is not obvious to distinguish from metrics what is consuming the memory.

//*Virtual memory* is a memory management scheme that is used by most operating systems ;
//it allows programs to use memory without dealing with hardware, or other concerns like
//sharing the memory resource. In doing so it allows programs to request more memory than
//available. In this scheme the OS splits the virtual memory and the memory in smaller chunks
//called *pages*. For any given page in the virtual memory, and depending on the application(s)
//the OS may:
//
//* Make this page resident in physical memory, if something has be written into it.
//* Do nothing if a page is not used, this page is virtually available.
//* Move a page from physical memory to swap, if the OS thinks there's not enough room for other pages.
//* Map a portion of a file to this page.

//E.g at the moment this report was executed the committed memory is `5380868 KiB` (`5.13 GiB`) while
//the process RSS is `4701120 KiB`. The difference relates to how `mmap` works (on Linux), memory
//pages are only backed by physical memory once they're written to.

Some people may have heard of the `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch` Hotspot option.
This option tells the JVM to
https://github.com/corretto/corretto-11/blob/3b31d243a19774bebde63df21cc84e994a89439a/src/src/hotspot/share/runtime/os.cpp#L1825-L1829[write a zero to every OS memory pages during the JVM startup].
This option has also the effect of avoiding physical memory commit
latencies later at runtime, however this only affects the heap memory zone.
Other JVM component that manage areas like thread stack or metaspace work
differently.

In other words that means parts of the *committed* memory shown in NMT is not *resident* and as such
RSS counter may not reflect what is seen in the *committed* memory.



== Sizing a cgroup / kubernetes `resources.memory.limit`

With containerization getting traction it is likely that
one has to face a memory related issue. Being equipped with
the right tooling and the tool manual is a precious help.

When a container is oomkilled either the application has problem
or its configuration is too tight.

Using the gathered information from JVM's native memory tracking and
from memory mapping, is it possible to build a simple _equation_ to
estimate the probable maximum memory usage of a process ?


[TIP]
====
* Set the cgroup memory limit high enough, so the application isn't oomkilled, this will
let you analyze how the app work, and adjust settings without fear (except from your
colleagues that compare everything to _Go_ or _rust_).

* If you don't think it's Java heap memory leak, i.e. the heap usage isn't alarming,
try to inspect native memory, it's easier with the flag `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch`,
however keep in mind this will bump your RSS right from the start, so anticipate this
increase in your cgroup memory limit.
====


We can already suppose there's every reported components from the JVM,
and the mapped files reported by NMT.

....
Total memory = Heap + GC + Metaspace + Code Cache + Symbol tables
               + Compiler + Other JVM structures + Thread stacks
               + Direct buffers + Mapped files
....


Above in this writing I noted NMT is not enough to account used memory.

While NMT show you the total, you can use this command to extract all relevant from the summary
in a simple addition and get back to the total committed.

Basically this shows that one must account at least this amount of data
when defining the kubernetes limit.


....
Total memory = Heap + GC + Metaspace + Code Cache + Symbol tables

               + ...
....

In my experience if the application doe not exhibit leaky behavior but just need
memory limit adjustment. The job is way easier using `AlwaysPreTouch`, then it's
easier to track evolution of "off-heap" memory.

Additionally, when sizing the memory limit, it's really important
to think about the OS page cache. Linux uses the _unused resident
memory_ to cache pages, usually the one backed by files.

Workloads that access the filesystem for a living, like Cassandra
or ElasticSearch will profit of the OS page cache. It's a good bet
to increase the memory limit for this cgroup.

By how much, that depends. I believe _page faults_ is a good indicator.
It's likely that if there's page faults of the container,
it means that the OS don't have the wanted pages in resident memory
and as such the kernel must fetch the backing data, likely on the
slower storage device. This is likely something that will negatively
affect the workload latencies.



== Closing words

A cgroup is a double-edged sword, it creates good conditions
to isolate a process. Being isolated, it gets easier to provision
the necessary resources in production. Defining these boundaries
is however a tedious task, having limits too narrow could increase
the chance of the container getting oomkilled or having poor performance,
giving a vast room will reduce the ability of Kubernetes to distribute
the workload, and it costs more.


In this very long writing, I showed two tools to survey the native
memory of a process. Java ships with a very interesting tracking
mechanism. I found out that inspecting Linux `/proc` filesystem, with
the help of `pmap` complement NMT well. Together they help to sort out
memory problems be it a limit should that needs adjustment or something
to fix in the application.

That being said it might be cheaper to look at other solutions, e.g.
if the production is running on Kubernetes it would be worth to have
a look at _auto-scalers_ provided by the platform.

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[Horizontal Pod Auto-scaler]
* https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/verticalpodautoscaler[Vertical Pod Auto-scaler]

I think that understanding how a workload use the memory is still a
sensible task, to make a better use of the auto-scalers.

[quote,, Famous last words]
The JVM is handling it.

I understand that having to go down that much may look superfluous and
almost zealous to when coming from the Java world.

In my opinion, containers changed the deal, the tighter constraints
that helped to increase the deployment density, are now backfiring.
On a side note those that tried cgroups with CPU limit have
likely experienced throttled on applications.
Memory wise rediscovering RSS is essential.
