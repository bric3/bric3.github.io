JDK Flight Recorder, the profiler you can use in production, continuously.
Flight Recorder has been available before in the JDK, e.g. it shipped as part of the JDK 8,
but to use it, it demanded a to set specific commercial VM flags to unlock
FlightRecorder, this is not anymore necessary with Java 11.

NOTE: This page assumes JDK 11, that means there is no need to set
`-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures`, `-XX:+FlightRecorder` flags. Or more particular to JFR
the use of `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions` and `-XX:+DebugNonSafepoints`

== Brief introduction to JDK Flight Recorder

Flight Recorder is a feature backed in the JVM that *traces* what's happening inside the JVM with *events*.
FlightRecorder development started a long time ago in the early 2000, on a JVM named JRockit.

_This JVM was first developed by a swedish company named Appeal, then Appeal got acquired by BEA.
Oracle acquired BEA, then acquired Sun, and merged the source of JRockit to Hotspot._

At some point BEA/Appeal engineers needed insight in their JVM, in production, logging was not an option
as it had too much overhead, so they designed an event based system to work reliably in production.

JDK Mission Control on the other end is a software that will analyze these events and build consolidated views
for us to analyze.

JFR with JDK Mission Control together are similar to system architectured as
https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html[_Event Sourcing_] system.

I won't dive in, but most profiler do have a bias when profiling and don't report accurate results.
The issue lies in how profiler handle JVM safepoints, most don't account properly the time spent in
safepoints. Some great profiler like the great https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler[async-profiler],
are not subject to these biases, JFR is also not subject to it.

== Using JFR

=== How to start a recording ?

One of the first interesting thing you can do is to start a recording at runtime ;
`jcmd` is the tool for this job, it's the Swiss Army knife tool for to service your Java app.
If you don't know it, use it's great !

Prior Java 11 FlightRecorder had to be enabled before use. Now it's not anymore necessary
it's possible to _start_ a JFR session.

.FlightRecorder is on by default
[source, bash]
----
$ jcmd $(pgrep java) VM.flags -all | grep FlightRecorder
     bool FlightRecorder                           = true                                      {product} {management}
    ccstr FlightRecorderOptions                    =                                           {product} {default}
----

Just runt `JFR.start` on the running java pid.

[source,bash]
----
$ jcmd $(pidof java) JFR.start
6:
Started recording 2. No limit specified, using maxsize=250MB as default.

Use jcmd 6 JFR.dump name=2 filename=FILEPATH to copy recording data to file.
----

The output guides the user to the next useful commands, in particular `JFR.dump`.
Also, this commands tells you that a recording by default is limited to 250Mb.
`jcmd` provides an `help` command that describes document for each command options.

.JFR.start example
[source, bash, role="primary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.start \
  name=app-profile \
  duration=300s \
  filename=/tmp/app-profile-$(date +%FT%H-%M-%S).jfr \
  settings=profile
6:
Started recording 2. The result will be written to:

/tmp/app-profile-2020-03-26T16-41-48.jfr
----

.JFR.start help
[source, bash, role="secondary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pgrep java) help JFR.start
6:
JFR.start
Starts a new JFR recording

Impact: Medium: Depending on the settings for a recording, the impact can range from low to high.

Permission: java.lang.management.ManagementPermission(monitor)

Syntax : JFR.start [options]

Options: (options must be specified using the <key> or <key>=<value> syntax)
	name : [optional] Name that can be used to identify recording, e.g. \"My Recording\" (STRING, no default value)
	settings : [optional] Settings file(s), e.g. profile or default. See JRE_HOME/lib/jfr (STRING SET, no default value)
	delay : [optional] Delay recording start with (s)econds, (m)inutes), (h)ours), or (d)ays, e.g. 5h. (NANOTIME, 0)
	duration : [optional] Duration of recording in (s)econds, (m)inutes, (h)ours, or (d)ays, e.g. 300s. (NANOTIME, 0)
	disk : [optional] Recording should be persisted to disk (BOOLEAN, no default value)
	filename : [optional] Resulting recording filename, e.g. \"/home/user/My Recording.jfr\" (STRING, no default value)
	maxage : [optional] Maximum time to keep recorded data (on disk) in (s)econds, (m)inutes, (h)ours, or (d)ays, e.g. 60m, or 0 for no limit (NANOTIME, 0)
	maxsize : [optional] Maximum amount of bytes to keep (on disk) in (k)B, (M)B or (G)B, e.g. 500M, or 0 for no limit (MEMORY SIZE, 0)
	dumponexit : [optional] Dump running recording when JVM shuts down (BOOLEAN, no default value)
	path-to-gc-roots : [optional] Collect path to GC roots (BOOLEAN, false)
----

In production you'll be most likely using `duration`, `maxsize`, `filename` and `settings` options.
We'll briefly look at other JFR commands after discussing the `settings`.

NOTE: Later in this article we'll see how to start recording from the command line
using `-XX:StartFlightRecording`.

=== Setting files

The `settings` option refers to a configuration of the FlightRecorder,
the JDK ships with two : `default` and `profile`. A configuration is an XML file, with
`event` elements that describe how JFR in the JVM will handle events, if they
are enabled, their threshold, if stacktraces are recorded, etc. And there is also a
`control` element that is used by JDK Mission Control.

Here's is the first few line of the `default` settings. As its name impies, this is the configuration
that is used when the command is run without a `settings` option.

.$JAVA_HOME/lib/jfr/default.jfc
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!--
     Recommended way to edit .jfc files is to use Java Mission Control,
     see Window -> Flight Recorder Template Manager.
-->

<configuration version="2.0"
               label="Continuous"
               description="Low overhead configuration safe for continuous use in production environments, typically less than 1 % overhead."
               provider="Oracle">

    <event name="jdk.ThreadAllocationStatistics">
      <setting name="enabled">true</setting>
      <setting name="period">everyChunk</setting>
    </event>

    <!-- a lot more events -->

    <!-- then the control element -->
</configuration>
----

In terms of file size magnitude on a pretty busy web application server using the `default` settings and for a
duration of 5 minutes, the resulting dumped file weighs 15 MiB. With this profile you'll get more than
basic information, IO, GC events, locking behavior, thread events, method profiling, etc.

The announced overhead is maximum 1% !

.$JAVA_HOME/lib/jfr/profile.jfc
[source, xml]
----
<!--
     Recommended way to edit .jfc files is to use Java Mission Control,
     see Window -> Flight Recorder Template Manager.
-->

<configuration version="2.0"
               label="Profiling"
               description="Low overhead configuration for profiling, typically around 2 % overhead."
               provider="Oracle">

    <event name="jdk.ThreadAllocationStatistics">
      <setting name="enabled">true</setting>
      <setting name="period">everyChunk</setting>
    </event>

    <!-- a lot more event -->
</configuration>
----

With the `profile` settings, the dumped file takes around 35mb for a 5min duration. And it will
get access to additional events like the `OldObjectSample` stacktraces, or TLS events
like TLS handshakes, X509 validation, Classloading events, etc.

It actually has a tad more overhead, 2%. But in most workload this should be ok.

To value of the `settings` option is file name of these files `default` or `profile`. In addition
it's also possible to pass an absolute file path, in other words it's possible to use configuration
of our own stored elsewhere.

=== Dumping a recording

If it's needed to acquire the recording, it's possible to dump it at anytime.

.JFR.dump example
[source, bash, role="primary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pidof java) JFR.dump filename=/tmp/app-profile-$(date +%FT%H-%M-%S).jfr
6:
Dumped recording, 239.5 MB written to:

/tmp/app-profile-2020-06-26T15-16-57.jfr
----

.JFR.dump help
[source, bash, role="secondary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pgrep java) help JFR.dump
6:
JFR.dump
Copies contents of a JFR recording to file. Either the name or the recording id must be specified.

Impact: Low

Permission: java.lang.management.ManagementPermission(monitor)

Syntax : JFR.dump [options]

Options: (options must be specified using the <key> or <key>=<value> syntax)
	name : [optional] Recording name, e.g. \"My Recording\" (STRING, no default value)
	filename : [optional] Copy recording data to file, e.g. \"/home/user/My Recording.jfr\" (STRING, no default value)
	maxage : [optional] Maximum duration to dump, in (s)econds, (m)inutes, (h)ours, or (d)ays, e.g. 60m, or 0 for no limit (NANOTIME, 0)
	maxsize : [optional] Maximum amount of bytes to dump, in (M)B or (G)B, e.g. 500M, or 0 for no limit (MEMORY SIZE, 0)
	begin : [optional] Point in time to dump data from, e.g. 09:00, 21:35:00, 2018-06-03T18:12:56.827Z, 2018-06-03T20:13:46.832, -10m, -3h, or -1d (STRING, no default value)
	end : [optional] Point in time to dump data to, e.g. 09:00, 21:35:00, 2018-06-03T18:12:56.827Z, 2018-06-03T20:13:46.832, -10m, -3h, or -1d (STRING, no default value)
	path-to-gc-roots : [optional] Collect path to GC roots (BOOLEAN, false)
----

If there is a single recording at the time it's possible to just use `JFR.dump`, but JFR is
powerful enough to support multiple concomitant recordings, in this case you need to specify
which recording to dump, obviously.
Some of the options override those defined in the start command like `filename` or `maxage`
for the current dump in particular. THe other options are certainly interesting but
I found them a bit less useful in practice.

=== Details of the active recording(s)

If they are multiple active recordings or if it's necessary to check the event configuration
of the active recording `jcmd` comes with the `JFR.check`.

.JFR.check example
[source, bash, role="primary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.check
6:
Recording 2: name=2 maxsize=250.0MB (running)
----

.JFR.check help
[source, bash]
----
$ jcmd $(pgrep java) help JFR.check
6:
JFR.check
Checks running JFR recording(s)

Impact: Low

Permission: java.lang.management.ManagementPermission(monitor)

Syntax : JFR.check [options]

Options: (options must be specified using the <key> or <key>=<value> syntax)
	name : [optional] Recording name, e.g. \"My Recording\" or omit to see all recordings (STRING, no default value)
	verbose : [optional] Print event settings for the recording(s) (BOOLEAN, false)
----

The `verbose` option allows examining which event are enabled for a recording.

=== Stopping a active recording

When the recording session is deemed over, then one can stop it providing a different
file name than the one set in the start command.

.JFR.stop example
[source, bash, role="primary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.stop \
  name=app-profile \
  filename=/tmp/app-profile-$(date +%FT%H-%M-%S).jfr
----

.JFR.stop help
[source, bash, role="secondary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pgrep java) help JFR.stop
6:
JFR.stop
Stops a JFR recording

Impact: Low

Permission: java.lang.management.ManagementPermission(monitor)

Syntax : JFR.stop [options]

Options: (options must be specified using the <key> or <key>=<value> syntax)
	name :  Recording text,.e.g \"My Recording\" (STRING, no default value)
	filename : [optional] Copy recording data to file, e.g. \"/home/user/My Recording.jfr\" (STRING, no default value)
----

=== Global Flight Recorder configuration

What we saw before is how to start a recording and how to configure this specific recording.
But there is another class of options that modifies aspects of the JFR internals.
As a reminder those affects all recording in some way.

.JFR.configure example
[source, bash, role="primary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pidof java) JFR.configure \
  stackdepth=96 \
  repositorypath=/tmp/jfr-repo
6:
Repository path: /tmp/jfr-repo/2020_06_26_16_01_58_6

Dump path: /gclogs

Stack depth: 96

$ jcmd $(pidof java) JFR.configure
6:
Current configuration:

Repository path: /tmp/jfr-repo/2020_06_26_16_03_41_6

Stack depth: 96
Global buffer count: 20
Global buffer size: 512.0 kB
Thread buffer size: 8.0 kB
Memory size: 10.0 MB
Max chunk size: 12.0 MB
Sample threads: true
----

.JFR.configure help
[source, bash, role="secondary"]
----
$ jcmd $(pidof java) help JFR.configure
80657:
JFR.configure
Configure JFR

Impact: Low

Permission: java.lang.management.ManagementPermission(monitor)

Syntax : JFR.configure [options]

Options: (options must be specified using the <key> or <key>=<value> syntax)
	repositorypath : [optional] Path to repository,.e.g \"My Repository\" (STRING, no default value)
	dumppath : [optional] Path to dump,.e.g \"My Dump path\" (STRING, no default value)
	stackdepth : [optional] Stack Depth (JULONG, 64)
	globalbuffercount : [optional] Number of global buffers, (JULONG, 20)
	globalbuffersize : [optional] Size of a global buffers, (MEMORY SIZE, 512k)
	thread_buffer_size : [optional] Size of a thread buffer (MEMORY SIZE, 8k)
	memorysize : [optional] Overall memory size,  (MEMORY SIZE, 10m)
	maxchunksize : [optional] Size of an individual disk chunk (MEMORY SIZE, 12m)
	samplethreads : [optional] Activate Thread sampling (BOOLEAN, true)
----

Here I'm increasing the `stackdepth`, this might be useful to generate more accurate flamegraphs,
or for some other analysis like with the `OldObjectSample`.

The `repositorypath` is where JFR dumps regularly slices or chunks of jfr events, they have
maximum size of `maxchunksize`. These files behave like a log rolling appender.
By default these chunks are stored in the temporary directory and in a subfolder with a timestamp.

.JFR repository
[source, bash]
----

-rw-r--r-- 1 43514 root 8.7M Jun 26 16:25 2020_06_26_16_21_50.part
----

_I'm not sure why some chunks are over 12M (the default chunk size) at this time._

Careful however as some of these options are not well documented, and may not expose
what we'd expect, e.g. `dumppath` only affects dump created when the app crashes and only
if the `dumponexit` recording option is true.

NOTE: These options are also available at startup via `-XX:FlightRecorderOptions`,
we'll see later how to use this option.


=== JFR logs

Thanks to unified logging, it's easy to open the hood on any JVM runtime feature.
In order to follow JFR, it's possible to JFR component, to understand how it works and
how options affect recordings.

=== Memory usage in the process

The section above describes where the actual data is saved for long or large
(`duration`, `maxage`, `maxsize`) profiling sessions, e.g. the reposotory, on disk,
will grow within these constraints. JFR is safe to enable in prod but there's an
overhead in memory as well, although it's usually minimal compared to the heap
or other native memory sections, but it's worth mentioning.

If NMT is enabled, you can just display the summary:

[source]
----
$ jcmd $(pidof java) VM.native_memory
6:

Native Memory Tracking:

Total: reserved=5324939KB, committed=3600539KB

...
----
<1> JFR's `Tracing` memory zone uses ~74MB

This was taken on a very active application, with custom events, you mileage
may vary.

The next output shows the committed memory for tracing, *after* a 6 min recording,
which means JFR will keep a memory zone any. That is the minimal JFR footprint
I experienced.

== Analyze with `jfr`

Now to exploit the recording, we have a tool named `jfr` that ships with the JDK.
On Linux the _alternative_ jdk management may not be aware of `jfr`, which means
you may need to use the full path to this executable.

The first interesting thing to do is to get an overview of the recording,
the `summary` sub-command displays an histogram of the events.

But other interesting things could be done using this tool.
The `print` sub-command can extract these events, in XML or in JSON. From there
it's possible to perform other type of aggregation using other tools.

  /gclogs/startup.jfr \

----

It's also possible to assemble `jfr` files or break them in smaller parts.
As a side note, the files in the _repository_ can be exploited this way.
Keep in mind these files may be removed as soon as they are expired or as
soon as every recording stops.

== Controlling JFR programmatically

While JDK 14 allows consuming events on the fly, previous JDK versions (from JDK 11)
offer a public API useful enough to control Flight Recorder programmatically or to
read events from a JFR file.

.Start JFR programmatically
[source, java]
----
Configuration c = Configuration.getConfiguration("profile"); // <1>
Recording r = new Recording(c);
r.setName("monitor jvm");
r.enable("jdk.*"); // <2>
r.setMaxAge(java.time.Duration.ofMinutes(4)); // <3>
r.start(); // <4>

// to be profiled

r.stop(); // <5>
r.dump(Files.createFile("/var/log/jfr/app-initiated.jfr")); // <6>
----
<1> As shown above choose the JFR configuration.
<2> Choose which events the recording should be interested in. Another signature accepts classes,
it's unlikely to be helpful for JDK events, but it may get interesting for custom events, your classes.
<3> Eventually set recording constraints, like the maximum age of the records.
<4> Hit record
<5> When the recording session is over, stop JFR.
<6> Then store the results in the location of your choosing.

The above snippet creates a continuous profiling session with a 4 minute window.
Now the API allows reading emitted `.jfr` files. The API represents what's actually
in a file, a schema of the events and the events themselves.

.Read JFR files yourself
[source, java]
----
try(RecordingFile rf = new RecordingFile(Paths.get("/var/log/jfr/app-initiated.jfr"))( { // <1>
    // read the schema
    rf.readEventTypes().forEach((EventType et) -> { // <2>
        System.out.println(et.getName());
        et.getFields()
          .stream()
          .map((ValueDescriptor vd) -> vd.getName())
          .forEach(System.out::println);
    });

    // actual events
    for(jdk.jfr.consumer.RecordedEvent e = rf.readEvent(); rf.hasMoreEvents(); e = rf.readEvent()) { // <3>
        System.out.println(e.getEventType().getName()); // <4>
    }
}
----
<1> Open the JFR file, it's a `Closeable` and it reads a file, so be sure to use
it in a try-with-resources block.
<2> `readEventTypes()` gets you the schema of the events, fields name, labels, thresholds, etc.
<3> Then there's this weird enumeration style api to read the events `hasMoreEvents()` and `readEvent()`
<4> Access details on the event type.

`RecordingFile` api is a bit awkward to work with, more specifically parsing each event
requires looking at the event descriptor (via `getEventType()`, or getFields()), and interrogate
the event as fields presence may evolve with each JDK revision. The javadoc advises defensive
programming style when reading a JFR file :

.snippet form javadoc
[source, java]
----
if (event.hasField("intValue")) {
   int intValue = event.getValue("intValue");
   System.out.println("Int value: " + intValue);
}
----

This API is now complemented by streaming live events https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/349[JEP-349]
in JDK 14 using an API `RecordingStream` that is mix of the above, that's out of scope for
this article. But that's yet another reason to make the effort to upgrade our JDK.

Such API facilities are useful especially when combined with other technologies like Spring Actuators.
Yet when there's available integration or when using these integrations is too late, like recording startup
the most actionable way to get recording is from the command line.


== How and when to record in production

The next points will present command line flags to set up JFR.


TIP: On JDK 11 there is the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/java.html#GUID-3B1CE181-CD30-4178-9602-230B800D4FAE[`JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS`]
environment variable. I found this variable particularly useful to tweak JVM parameters
in a containerized environment without having to rebuild the image. This environment variable
only affects `java` while JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS affects any binary in the JDK `java`, `jps`, `jcmd`, etc.

// More on https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.html#GUID-0FE29092-18B5-4BEB-8D8D-0CBA7A4FEA1D


While it would certainly be useful to record the whole lifetime, this is unpractical, even plane
Flight Data Recorder (and Cockpit Voice Recorder) only keep recent history. Instead,
it's possible to aim at specific time frames where a recording could be useful:

* At *startup*, the JVM does a lot of things, so does the application, it generally initialize a lot
of long lived objects, generally services, threads, etc.

* *Continuously* at *runtime*, this is likely a sliding time window in which one can access what's
happened in last _X <time unit>_ (this is either limited by age or by size). It this case the dump
could be done when required.

* At *shutdown* whether the JVM was *killed* or *crashed*. It this case the JFR files are an alternative
to heap dumps for the autopsy.

=== Record application startup

I mentioned startup as a separate window, because it's useful to inspect startup recording.
During this time, the JVM intialize a lot of things, most code has yet to be warmed up,
depending on the worload there may be a lot of allocations.

I found that having these startup recording very useful to tune the readyness of an application, as we'll see after.


.Time bound recording at JVM startup
[source]
----
-XX:StartFlightRecording=settings=profile,duration=6m,name=app-startup,filename=/var/log/jfr/app-startup.jfr
----

Eventually it's possible to tweak this recording with, other parameters like

* `path-to-gc-roots=true`, which allows to identify leaks using the `OldObjectSample` (enabled in
the `profile` settings)
* `maxsize` to set a size threshold to the recording
* `disk=false` if you want to keep the event in memory only before dumping to the configured `filename`.
Otherwise the JVM will use it's default strategy which is to evacuate chunks of event to disk, in the JFR
`repository` (by default a folder in the temporary folder).

In addition to these recording parameter, it can be useful to set a few JFR wide options, i.e. that affects all
recordings, e.g. `-XX:FlightRecorderOptions=stackdepth=96`, which augments the size of the _captured_ stack,
be advised, that the bigger the number the higher the impact.

.In the container, checking JFR
[source]
----
❯ jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.check
6:
Recording 1: name=app-startup duration=6m (running) <1>
❯ jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.check
6:
No available recordings. <2>

Use jcmd 6 JFR.start to start a recording.
❯ ls -lah /var/log/jfr/app-startup.jfr
-rw-r--r--   1 root root 57M May  6 22:35 /var/log/jfr/app-startup.jfr
----
<1> Indicates the configured 30s recording is ongoing.
<2> No more recording once the duration is over.

I'll show how to use this recording later in this article.


=== Record application post-startup or continuous recording

Once startup has been recording, it's useful to set up a continuous recording.
The good thing is that the JVM allows to define multiple recording
in the command line. Let's add another `-XX:StartFlightRecording`
with the `delay` parameter.

.Delayed continuous recording
[source]
----
-XX:StartFlightRecording=settings=profile,delay=5m,maxage=10m,name=post-startup,filename=/var/log/jfr/post-startup.jfr
----

This will register a continuous profiling that will start 5m after the JVM starts. And
it sets a retention of 10 minutes, or a retention of the default maximum size which is `250 MiB` in JDK11.

If this is the only recording, `JFR.check` will output something like that.

.In the container, checking JFR
[source]
----
❯ jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.check
6:
Recording 1: name=post-startup maxage=10m (delayed) <1>
❯ jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.check
6:
Recording 1: name=app-startup maxage=10m (running) <2>
----
<1> Indicates there's a recording that will start at some point in the future.
<2> Indicates the configured continuous recording is ongoing.

Note that in the case of the continuous recording it's necessary to dump the recording
via `JFR.dump`.


=== Recording for shutdown

The only thing to do is to set the recording parameter `dumponexit=true` (on each recording).
The record will be stored in the configured `filename` otherwise JFR will create a file similar
to this the working directory of the process `hotspot-pid-6-id-1-2020_05_03_12_54_14.jfr`

[NOTE]
====
The JVM source code, suggest that JFR has the notion of
https://github.com/corretto/corretto-11/blob/caa2f4cad666b508a88b92db01054ace8647a820/src/src/hotspot/share/jfr/recorder/repository/jfrEmergencyDump.cpp#L250[emergency JFR dump],
but the mechanism is different as it seems those are dumped in the
working directory of the process, which may not be writable in a container. I don't
think it's currently possible to change the location. But
from what I've seen SOE or OOM are dumped fine via `dumponexit=true` and `filename=...`.

1. OutOfMemory => `hs_oom_pid<pid>.jfr`
2. StackOverflowError => `hs_soe_pid<pid>.jfr`
3. Other error => `hs_err_pid<pid>.jfr`

=== Putting it all together

Putting it all together, let's put these in the `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS`.

.record startup then record continuously, and dump on exit

-XX:FlightRecorderOptions=stackdepth=96
----


After acquiring the record files, you are ready to exploit them. We've seen `jfr` on which
it's possible to build upon, now the next section briefly presents the other elephant in the room
(in a positive way), *JDK Mission Control* which empowers its user with remarkable diagnosis skills.


== JDK Mission Control

JDK Mission Control, is a tool that will make sense of all these events, and it excels at that.

In an event sourcing system, the query part of the system is what empowers the view,
JDK Mission Control uses these events to present several consolidated views tailored
to diagnose several part of the JVM runtime, and more if using _custom events_.

On macOs you can install it via Homebrew (`brew cask install jdk-mission-control`).

As mentioned earlier Mission Control was present before in the JDK, however it's
user interface evolved quite a bunch and following the official
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/troubleshoot/diagnostic-tools.html#GUID-7E8058D0-249E-44DB-8714-3AA9DA6A4DB8[Oracle troubleshooting guide for Java 11]
to inspect a recording may get be a bit confusing. And even the shipped help pages
of JMC are sometime outdated, or explicit about which version of the JDK the help section makes
references to.

TIP: At this time the JDK Mission Control 7.1 is available, and the 8 snapshot are also
available for the edge users. I'm using the 8 snapshots but the 7.1 does the job very fine.


Enough text, let's see how to use JDK Mission Control on a concrete issue.

TIP: A large screen will be really appreciated when looking at JMC. My 13 inches laptop
is way too narrow in my opinion, using a 27 inches monitor really adds to usability.


== Real case startup request latencies

At some point we had an issue with application startup performance.
For a bit of context this app runs in a Kubernetes cluster, with k8s it's possible
to define a _rollout policy_ to avoid service distruption, that what we had, so there's a
rollout, new pods (a pod is composed of the application container) get created,
new application are started, then Kubernetes has a mean to check when the application is
*ready*, it's called the readyness probe. This probe can be a call to http endpoint or a script,
ours is an HTTP endpoint.

WHen the probe indicates the application is ready, the application starts receiving traffic,
from this moment latencies increased from 10-20 milliseconds to seconds.

Opening the recording JMC, it will start an automated analysis. Sometime it's helpful
and warning should be looked at. In this case the issue was elsewhere.

To help in our case, we need to go in the thread view, which as a _thread lanes_
which displays each thread as an horizontal bar, and JFR event are painted on the bar
at the time they happened and for how long. At the bottom there's a the time axis.

.Thread Lanes
image::/assets/jfr/startup-0-thread-lanes.png[align="center"]

The first things that catch our eyes will be the vertical patterns, especially the one with
yellow and red around 12:51:15. Let's zoom (you can select and right click, or use arrow keys.).

.Zooming on the problematic
image::/assets/jfr/startup-0-threads-lanes-closer.png[align="center"]

The vertical pattern is more precise, these vertical pattern indicates a _cross
threads phenomena_. And we can notice that all thread are not affected the same way.

The lanes in green at the top indicates these threads are progressing normally, nothing's
wrong with them. However is we go down there especially, the pattern materialize around
12:51:11.

Each color indicate some events

* Gray => the thread does nothing, it's parked
* Small dark point => The park event, the thread was scheduled but was eventually parked
* Red => In this case it's a _blocked lock_
* Yellow => Here the yellow events that intrests us are thread waiting on a lock

I'm not well versed in desfribing colors, so know that there are other events that use
a slightly different tone / shade of red, yellow or else. Just click on the event
to see what's going on.

.monitor blocked
image::/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-lock-event.png[align="center"]

The UI could be improved but going over the events shows a popup with it's details,
for the Monitor Blocked event, there's the duration this monitor was block, who held
this monitor before, and the monitor address in the heap.

This monitor was held for ~9s, that's a big bottleneck !

image::/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-acquire-blocked.png[align="center"]

In this case we had ~200 thread competing for this lock in particular. And finding the thread that
acquired it is not automated, it's a bit tedious, but in the end didn't revealed anything.

However the Monitor Blocked event has another interesting element, the stacktrace. In the lower
pane of JMC, if the event is selected, we can see the stack trace where this event was emmitted.

.jedis classloading
image::/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-blocked-stack.png[align="center"]

Here that's the JDK classloader. I would never have thought that the JDK code would cause ~9s
contention. But looking at the stacktrace, there _jedis_ (a Redis client) connection pool involved.
Maybe the class have static initialization that does IO, maybe it's the agent that runs in production
that introduces latencies during this specific classlaoding.

But all the threads starts working again around 12:51:22, and redis bottle neck is not anymore an issue
afterward. Let's look at the story on the IO side, open the Socket IO view.

Identify which one is related to redis, either via IP or via port (Redis is `6379`).

.Socket IO with redis port selected
image::/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis-port.png[align="center"]

While we see a total time of 30s, it's the accumulated time for all thread for the recording duration (6m).
So nothing fancy here. However we see that actual IO happens really late, around 12:51:22.

.Socket IO actual Redis read / write
image::/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis.png[align="center"]

I'm not sure of the cause, we can definitely rule out Redis, the is either in the network, during
connection establishment, or actually during classloading.

In order to remediate that, we noticed this code is called once the application is ready.
So in order to avoid the contention the code was changed to pre-connect to redis during the
application startup before the the application is considedred ready. And it worked, this
specific issue disappeared.

image::/assets/jfr/startup-2-thread-lanes.png[align="center"]

However as knew from the first recording, and now the second iteration this was not the only issue
identified when flying over the yellow and red events.

All the stacktraces above have one thing in common, a contention on a lock.
As thread wer blocked, and new request appeared, this had the effects of increase the
queuing, and made tomcat creates new http nio worked threads until the maximum is reached
(200 by default). So applied the same trick, i.e exercise code path that are lazy
initialized befre readyness. And it worked too. Most contention disappeared.

.Better startup / C2 compiler event
image::/assets/jfr/startup-3-C2-compiler.png[align="center"]

There was still some potential gain however. We noticed a few C2 compiler events,
If you don't know C1 and C2, it's the compilers that transform bytecode to assembly.
While C1 is somewhat superficial in optimizing the assembly, but it requires few
CPU and it allows code to be executed asap yet not as efficient as possible. In a
second phase C2 may kick in, this one outputs highly optimized code for hot code path
(code that is executed very, very often), but it requires resources.

Note however this event is not blocking threads !

As an experiment I decided to use the Graal compiler, which I believe is the new
generation of compiler. https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/compiler/README.md[Graal compiler]
is part of the https://github.com/oracle/graal[GraalVM] project.
It ships as an experimental option : `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseJVMCICompiler`.

And the result for this work load in particular.

.Improved P99
image::/assets/jfr/startup-3-grafana.png[align="center"]

This graph is falling under the https://latencytipoftheday.blogspot.com/2014/06/latencytipoftheday-most-page-loads.html[_percentlie_]
but the improvement is still visible.

Now when we analyzed the new profile we noticed that JVM was using a lot of time to
revoke bias locking. Note the events in fushia are custom JFR events that track HTTP requests.
(https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling[Gunnar Morling] has an inspiring
https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/[write up] about it).

This VM operation is done during safepoint during which the JVM is paused. At this time a lot of
of bias revocation event appears, so we removed them, and it works too.

.Revoke Bias locking
image::/assets/jfr/startup-4-threads-revoke-biased-locks.png[align="center"]

The graphic shows the difference in startup time. Other consuming backend services had to timeout
and eventually perform retries during rollouts which increased the pressure on the application.

.Before => after

Other smaller issues can be handled, for example I noticed a few gaps 200ms wide at 30/1min intervals
that were related to GC pauses.

.GC gaps

GC is working within 20ms excepts for a few pauses during the early minutes:

Tuning GC is out of scope for this article, but JMC presents a nice view that could help identify GC
causes. In my opinion it's currently a bit less powerful as GC logs as events may lack
useful information found in GC logs.

.Garbage Collection view

Anyway from there we could imagine a setting file in the JDK dedicated for GC events.
Instead of parsing log files that may change a bit over releases (even with unified logging)
GC events could be analyzed leveraging the included JFR schema.

It's even possible to record memory leak, I never tried that in a real situation though,
but if this avoids the need to make a heap dump and parse in I'm all in.

== Wrap up

Use JFR in production, use JDK Mission Control !

I' amazed by the professionalism and the quality of the work BEA put in their JVM (JRockit) in
the early 2000s, thanks to these talented engineer, we have JFR and `jcmd` (which was named `jrcmd`).
And thanks to Oracle for making these available for all !.

Quick thanks to https://twitter/delabasse[David Delabasse] on his comments.
