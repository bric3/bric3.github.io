title: "Tweakable JVM setting per helm release"
draft: true
---

Circa 2019 I had the chance to run many Java server applications, I wrote down
out our best practices in order to iterate faster to find the right values for
the JVM, but instead how to leverage Helm to try JVM settings.

As a pre-requisite, the reader must know about

 * https://docker.com[*Docker*] : It is an open-source project that helps to produce self-sufficient
containers that can run on any platform supporting containers. In particular,
it is useful for deployment automation. Moreover, it is practical tool to use
for development.
 * https://kubernetes.io[*Kubernetes*] : It is an open-source container orchestration system. In
particular, it can be configured to automate certain task such as deployment,
scaling, and management. It was originally created by Google, but is now part
of the https://www.cncf.io/[CNCF]. It's usually abbreviated as `k8s`.
 * https://helm.sh[*Helm*] : Helm is an open-source project destined to manage
applications running on Kubernetes. In particular, Helm serves a way to version,
configure and deploy applications. It's main document is known as a _Helm Chart_.

== Choosing a better value for the Java heap

This is usually the first concrete flag we have to do to configure a JVM.

If you've followed the improvements of the JDK you know since JDK 11 it is
_kinda_supporting containers via the addition of the `-XX:*RAMPercentage`
flags. Or not.

Circa 2019 I basically did try to set a magical fixed value for the heap size
through `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=xx` set in the `Dockerfile`.

[source, Dockerfile]
----
CMD [ "/usr/bin/java", \
      "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8", \
      "-Duser.timezone=UTC", \
      "-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom", \
      "-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=85.0", \ <1>
      "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=85.0", \ <1>
      "-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary", \
      "-Xlog:os,safepoint*,gc*,gc+ref=debug,gc+ergo*=debug,gc+age*=debug,gc+phases*:file=/gclogs/%t-gc.log:time,uptime,tags:filecount=5,filesize=10M", \
      "-javaagent:/agent-1.jar", \
      "-javaagent:/agent-2.jar", \
      "-jar", \
      "/java-app-boot.jar", \
      "--spring.config.additional-location=/etc/java-app/config.yaml", \
      "--server.port=8080" ]
----
<1> Sets the heap size to 85% of the total RAM (equivalent to setting
`Xms` and `Xmx` at the same value).

Of course this didn't
work really well for two reasons :

1. The value didn't adapt well to actual trafic conditions. It is related to how
`-XX:*RAMPercentage` is designed to work, in my opinion these flags should be
avoided.
+
CAUTION: I believe link:{{< ref "posts/2020-10-27-MaxRamPercentage-is-not-what-i-wished-for.adoc" >}}[now]
this flag family is impractical at best if not an anti-pattern when
used in production containers.

2. Since the values was set in a Dockerfile as they were not supposed to be
adjusted that much, it was long to actually publish and try new settings.
Each change had to go through the whole build pipeline (even
if some shortcuts were possible, thanks to Gradle in this regard).

3. The container had to be deployed in different environments with different
conditions, hence different resource requirement.

_In the aftermath I still feel that I was dumb to even thought it could work._


Since Helm was used it was time to leverage it.

== Make the Docker image memory settings tweakable per environment

As seen at the above, RAM settings are part of the command declaration.
First these arguments turned out to be incorrect, but they are more difficult
to change or tweak. In addition, the deployment requirements / limits are likely
to differ depending on the cluster / environment ; this can happen when you need
to reduce the money spent on the cloud provider for non-production clusters,
like staging, pre-production, etc.

The first tip is to use the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/java.html#GUID-3B1CE181-CD30-4178-9602-230B800D4FAE[`JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS`]
environment variable for more flexibility and remove the RAM percentage in the
`CMD` directive.

Now let's test this locally.

=== Run the container locally with the Java app

In this local test series, I'm using `3 GiB` as a memory limit, and I chose 70%
for the heap percentage.

<1> Max heap is about `2.1 GiB`


Notice when there's no RAM settings the JVM computed the max heap size at 25%
of `3 GiB` memory limit, and at 70% the jvm uses `2.1 GiB`. Also, the heap values
are the only one affected.
